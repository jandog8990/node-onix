      <d104><![CDATA[<b>The <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Montgomery/Taggert Family series returns with a sizzling romance &ldquo;packed full of warmth, humor, sensual tension, and </b><b>exciting adventure&rdquo; (</b><b><i>RT Book Reviews</i></b><b>) about a New York businesswoman on the run in Florida after being falsely accused of murder. </b><BR><BR>A rising star at a Manhattan corporation, Fiona Burkenhalter is a New Yorker through and through and when her boss inexplicably sends her to handle a new account in the Florida Everglades, it may as well be another planet. But this is no ordinary business meeting: Fiona is to join her client on a rustic fishing expedition, accompanied by a guide with the larger-than-life name of Ace Montgomery. <BR> <BR>More than a little steamed at this detour from the executive fast track, Fiona never imagined that she&rsquo;d embarked on the wildest adventure of her life&#8212;or that the rough-hewn, undeniably handsome Ace Montgomery from the Southern backwoods would become her closest ally. But hair-raising circumstances pull her deep into trouble from the moment she steps off the plane. Only in the heart of the swamplands could she get lost in a maze of intrigue and become the prime suspect for a shocking murder with Ace as her presumed accomplice. Suddenly, they discover that they have inherited the murder victim&rsquo;s vast fortune and they are now Florida&rsquo;s most wanted couple! <BR> <BR>Now, with their lives <i>and</i> hearts on the line, they turn up the heat in their desperate search for a killer.]]></d104>

As he describes the insatiable curiosity of Calamity's Indian friend No Ears, Annie Oakley's shooting match with Lord Windhouveren, and other highlights of the tour, McMurtry turns the story of a band of hardy, irrepressible survivors into an unforgettable portrait of love, fellowship, dreams, and heartbreak.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>A young widow inherits a run-down farmhouse and a whole new beginning in Virginia in this charming and emotional novel from the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Summerhouse</i>. </b><BR><BR>Quiet, unassuming, and overweight, Lillian did anything and everything to please her husband of twenty years, the illustrious self-made billionaire James Manville. Since the tender age of seventeen, she had obeyed this powerful older man&rsquo;s every command and in return she received a life beyond her wildest dreams. Elaborate mansions. Trips around the world. The finest jewels and the most luxurious fashions. <BR> <BR>But when Jimmie dies suddenly in a plane crash, Lillian&rsquo;s pampered life comes to an abrupt halt. She learns that Jimmie has bequeathed all of his riches to his devious siblings. All, that is, except an old farmhouse in small-town Virginia. Although Lillian is devastated by Jimmie's death and apparent betrayal, she soon discovers a well of secrets connected to Jimmie&rsquo;s past and uncovering them, she thinks, will help her to better understand the man she loved and mysteriously lost. <BR> <BR>What Lillian doesn&rsquo;t foresee is how her unexpected circumstances quickly transform her. She loses weight, changes her name to avoid further harassment from the press, and, with the help of Matthew Longacre, a kind, handsome local man, begins to renovate the farmhouse and establish friendships with the quirky townspeople. In time she develops her own thriving business and an inner strength she never knew existed. But, though Lillian&rsquo;s new life seems as strong as the mulberry tree firmly planted outside her farmhouse, there remain secrets and lies that threaten to uproot the past she cherished and the future she will fight to protect.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[Larry McMurtry&#8217;s <i>Terms of Endearment</i> touched readers in a way no other story has in recent years. The earthy humor and the powerful emotional impact that set this novel apart rise to brilliant new heights with <i>The Evening Star</i>.<BR><BR>McMurtry takes us deep into the heart of Texas, and deep into the heart of one of the most memorable characters of our time, Aurora Greenway&#8212;along with her family, friends, and lovers&#8212;in a tale of affectionate wit, bittersweet tenderness, and the unexpected turns that life can take. This is Larry McMurtry at his very best: warm, compassionate, full of comic invention, an author so attuned to the feelings, needs, and desires of his characters that they possess a reality unique in American fiction.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<I>New York Times </I>bestselling author of <I>The Wordy Shipmates </I>and contributor to NPR&#8217;s "This American Life" Sarah Vowell embarks on a road trip to sites of political violence, from Washington DC to Alaska, to better understand our nation&#8217;s ever-evolving political system and history.<BR><BR>Sarah Vowell exposes the glorious conundrums of American history and culture with wit, probity, and an irreverent sense of humor. With <i>Assassination Vacation</i>, she takes us on a road trip like no other -- a journey to the pit stops of American political murder and through the myriad ways they have been used for fun and profit, for political and cultural advantage.<BR> <BR> From Buffalo to Alaska, Washington to the Dry Tortugas, Vowell visits locations immortalized and influenced by the spilling of politically important blood, reporting as she goes with her trademark blend of wisecracking humor, remarkable honesty, and thought-provoking criticism. We learn about the jinx that was Robert Todd Lincoln (present at the assassinations of Presidents Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley) and witness the politicking that went into the making of the Lincoln Memorial. The resulting narrative is much more than an entertaining and informative travelogue -- it is the disturbing and fascinating story of how American death has been manipulated by popular culture, including literature, architecture, sculpture, and -- the author's favorite -- historical tourism. Though the themes of loss and violence are explored and we make detours to see how the Republican Party became the Republican Party, there are all kinds of lighter diversions along the way into the lives of the three presidents and their assassins, including mummies, show tunes, mean-spirited totem poles, and a nineteenth-century biblical sex cult.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<I>Boone's Lick</I> is Pulitzer Prize-winning author Larry McMurtry's triumphant return to the kind of story that made him famous -- an enthralling tale of the nineteenth-century West. <BR> McMurtry brings his unique blend of historical fact and sheer storytelling genius to the Cecil family's arduous journey from Boone's Lick, Missouri, to Fort Phil Kearny in Wyoming. Fifteen year old Shay describes the journey that begins when his Ma, Mary Margaret, decides to hunt down her elusive husband, Dick, to tell him she's leaving him. <BR> The family sets out across the plains in search of him, encountering grizzly bears, stormy weather and hostile Indians as they go. With them are Shay's siblings G.T., Neva and Baby Marcy, Shay's uncle Seth, his Granpa Crackenthorpe, and Mary Margaret's beautiful half-sister Rose. During their journey they pick up a bare-footed priest named Father Villy, and a Snake Indian named Charlie Seven Days, and persuade them to come along. <BR> <I>Boone's Lick</I> is high adventure, a perfect Western tale and a moving love story -- it is vintage McMurtry, combining his brilliant character portraits, his unerring sense of the West and his unrivalled eye for the telling detail.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>2007 Audie Award Finalist for Classics</b><BR><BR><b>&ldquo;The ideal companion for troubled times: equal parts Continental escape and serious grappling with the question of what it means to be, and feel, lost.&rdquo; &#8212; <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b><BR> <BR><b>One of America&rsquo;s best-loved novels by PBS&rsquo;s <i>The Great American Read</i></b><BR><BR><i>The Sun Also Rises</i> is a classic example of Hemingway&rsquo;s spare but powerful writing style. It celebrates the art and craft of Hemingway&rsquo;s quintessential story of the Lost Generation&#8212;presented by the Hemingway family with illuminating supplementary material from the Hemingway Collection at the John F. Kennedy Library.<BR> <BR>A poignant look at the disillusionment and angst of the post-World War I generation, the novel introduces two of Hemingway&rsquo;s most unforgettable characters: Jake Barnes and Lady Brett Ashley. The story follows the flamboyant Brett and the hapless Jake as they journey from the wild nightlife of 1920s Paris to the brutal bullfighting rings of Spain with a motley group of expatriates. It is an age of moral bankruptcy, spiritual dissolution, unrealized love, and vanishing illusions. First published in 1926, <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> is &ldquo;an absorbing, beautifully and tenderly absurd, heartbreaking narrative...a truly gripping story, told in lean, hard, athletic prose&rdquo; (<i>The New York Times</i>).<BR> <BR>The Hemingway Library Edition commemorates Hemingway&rsquo;s classic novel with a personal foreword by Patrick Hemingway, the author&rsquo;s sole surviving son, and an introduction by Sean Hemingway, grandson of the author. Hemingway considered the extensive rewriting that he did to shape his first novel the most difficult job of his life. Early drafts, deleted passages, and possible titles included in this new edition elucidate how the author achieved his first great literary masterpiece.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[Reading Group Guide for <I>The Sun Also Rises</I><BR> <B>Introduction</B><BR> Ernest Hemingway was born July 21, 1899, in Oak Park, Illinois. After graduation from high school, he moved to Kansas City, Missouri, where he worked briefly for the <I>Kansas City Star.</I> Failing to qualify for the United States Army because of poor eyesight, he enlisted with the American Red Cross to drive ambulances in Italy. He was severely wounded on the Austrian front on July 9, 1918. Following recuperation in a Milan hospital, he returned home and became a freelance writer for the <I>Toronto Star.</I> <BR> In December of 1921, he sailed to France and joined an expatriate community of writers and artists in Paris while continuing to write for the <I>Toronto Star.</I> There his fiction career began in "little magazines" and small presses and led to a volume of short stories, <I>In Our Time</I> (1925). His novels <I>The Sun Also Rises</I> (1926) and <I>A Farewell to Arms</I> (1929) established Hemingway as the most important and influential fiction writer of his generation. His later collections of short stories and <I>For Whom the Bell Tolls</I> (1940) affirmed his extraordinary career while his highly publicized life gave him unrivaled celebrity as a literary figure.<BR> Hemingway became an authority on the subjects of his art: trout fishing, bullfighting, big-game hunting, and deep-sea fishing, and the cultures of the regions in which he set his work -- France, Italy, Spain, Cuba, and Africa. <BR> <I>The Old Man and the Sea</I> (1952) earned him the Pulitzer Prize and was instrumental in his being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1954. Hemingway died in Ketchum, Idaho, on July 2, 1961.<BR> <B>Description</B><BR> Jake Barnes, an American newspaperman emasculated by a wound suffered in Italy during World War I, is living and working in Paris in the expatriate community. He takes friends Bill Gorton, Lady Brett Ashley (whom Jake loves), her fianc&#233;, Mike Campbell, and Robert Cohn (also in love with Brett) to Spain for trout fishing and bullfighting during the festival of San Fermin in Pamplona. Tensions mount among Campbell, Cohn, and Barnes over Brett and intensify as she falls in love with Pedro Romero, a nineteen-year-old bullfighter. At the end of the festival, Brett leaves with Romero, Bill returns to Paris, Mike goes to St. Jean de Luz, and Jake goes to San Sebastian for a respite soon ended when he receives a telegram from Brett. Jake goes immediately to her aid in Madrid, where he finds her momentarily remorseful and evading truth about Romero and her relationship with Jake.<BR> <B>Discussion Questions</B><BR> 1. When Jake Barnes rebuffs the prostitute Georgette because he is "sick," she says, "Everybody's sick. I'm sick, too" (p.23). Is Georgette's observation an appropriate description of the people in the novel? Why is Jake's emasculating wound such an effective symbol?<BR> 2. When Jake and Bill walk during the Paris evening looking at Notre Dame, watching young lovers, and savoring cooking smells, Jake asks whether Bill would like a drink. Why does Bill respond, "No...I don't need it" (p. 83)? Why does Jake say that for Cohn the Bayonne cathedral was "a very good example of something or other" (p. 96)?<BR> 3. Is Jake and Bill's fishing trip to Burguete relevant to the epigraph from Ecclesiastes? How do their conversations in Burguete differ from those they have back in Pamplona? How do Robert's, Mike's, and Brett's absences from the fishing trip set them apart from Jake and Bill? Why is the Englishman Harris included in the Burguete scene?<BR> 4. How would you describe Jake Barnes's relationship with Brett? Does he love her; understand her? Is his view of Brett constant? How does he see her at the close of the novel? What does he mean when he says, "Isn't it pretty to think so," when Brett tells him that they "could have had such a damned good time together" (p. 251)?<BR> 5. If Hemingway's novel is about "the lost generation," do we conclude that all five of the persons who have gone to Pamplona are lost? Is there evidence that moral or spiritual cleansing ever takes place in the novel?<BR><B>After Reading the Novel</B><BR>It would be difficult to overstate the remarkable influence of <I>The Sun Also Rises</I> upon its millions of readers. Not only did Hemingway's novel influence our prose and our conduct, it introduced Paris and Pamplona to many of us and made them so real that when we visit them, we feel as if we are returning for a closer look rather than seeing them for the first time. Several guides to Hemingway's Paris, complete with maps, photographs, and walking tours are in print which would provide your group with an opportunity to follow Jake Barnes's footsteps down the little side street Rue Delambre at the intersection of the Boulevard Raspail and Montparnasse to the Dingo Bar, where Jake and Brett had drinks, and Ernest Hemingway met Scott Fitzgerald for the first time in the spring of 1925. Guidebooks will also lead you through narrow streets of Pamplona where the bulls run and along Paseo Hemingway to the bullring, where a bust of the famous writer stands, bearing a statement of gratitude to him from the people of Spain.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>The last uncompleted novel of Ernest Hemingway, published posthumously in 1986, charts the life of a young American writer and his glamorous wife who fall for the same woman.</b><BR><BR>A sensational bestseller when it appeared in 1986, <i>The Garden of Eden</i> is the last uncompleted novel of Ernest Hemingway, which he worked on intermittently from 1946 until his death in 1961. Set on the C&#244;te d'Azur in the 1920s, it is the story of a young American writer, David Bourne, his glamorous wife, Catherine, and the dangerous, erotic game they play when they fall in love with the same woman. "A lean, sensuous narrative...taut, chic, and strangely contemporary," <i>The Garden of Eden</i> represents vintage Hemingway, the master "doing what nobody did better" (R. Z. Sheppard, <i>Time).</i>]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>Ernest Hemingway's classic exploration of the history and pageantry of bullfighting, and the deeper themes of cowardice, bravery, sport and tragedy that it inspires.</b><BR><BR>Still considered one of the best books ever written about bullfighting, <i>Death in the Afternoon</i> reflects Hemingway's belief that bullfighting was more than mere sport. Here he describes and explains the technical aspects of this dangerous ritual, and "the emotional and spiritual intensity and pure classic beauty that can be produced by a man, an animal, and a piece of scarlet serge draped on a stick." Seen through his eyes, bullfighting becomes an art, a richly choreographed ballet, with performers who range from awkward amateurs to masters of great grace and cunning.<BR> <BR>A fascinating look at the history and grandeur of bullfighting, <i>Death in the Afternoon</i> is also a deeper contemplation on the nature of cowardice and bravery, sport and tragedy, and is enlivened throughout by Hemingway's pungent commentary on life and literature.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>The most intimate and elaborately enhanced addition to the Hemingway Library series: Hemingway&rsquo;s memoir of his safari across the Serengeti&#8212;presented with archival material from the Hemingway Collection at the John F. Kennedy Library and with the never-before-published safari journal of Hemingway&rsquo;s second wife, Pauline Pfeiffer.</b><BR><BR>When it was first published in 1935, <i>The New York Times</i> called <i>Green Hills of Africa</i>, &#8220;The best-written story of big-game hunting anywhere,&#8221; Hemingway&#8217;s evocative account of his safari through East Africa with his wife, Pauline Pfeiffer, captures his fascination with big-game hunting. In examining the grace of the chase and the ferocity of the kill, Hemingway looks inward, seeking to explain the lure of the hunt and the primal undercurrent that comes alive on the plains of Africa. <i>Green Hills of Africa</i> is also an impassioned portrait of the glory of the African landscape and the beauty of a wilderness that was, even then, being threatened by the incursions of man.<BR> <BR>This new Hemingway Library Edition offers a fresh perspective on Hemingway&#8217;s classic travelogue, with a personal foreword by Patrick Hemingway, the author&#8217;s sole surviving son, who spent many years as a professional hunter in East Africa; a new introduction by Se&#225;n Hemingway, grandson of the author; and, published for the first time in its entirety, the African journal of Hemingway&#8217;s wife, Pauline, which offers an intimate glimpse into thoughts and experiences that shaped her husband&#8217;s craft.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>The definitive short story collection that established Ernest Hemingway's literary reputation, originally published in 1938.</b><BR><BR>Ernest Hemingway is a cultural icon&#8212;an archetype of rugged masculinity, a romantic ideal of the intellectual in perpetual exile&#8212;but, to his countless readers, Hemingway remains a literary force much greater than his image. Of all of Hemingway&rsquo;s canonical fictions, perhaps none demonstrate so forcefully the power of the author&rsquo;s revolutionary style as his short stories. In classics like &ldquo;Hills like White Elephants,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Butterfly in the Tank,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber,&rdquo; Hemingway shows us great literature compressed to its most potent essentials. We also see, in Hemingway&rsquo;s short fiction, the tales that created the legend: these are stories of men and women in love and in war and on the hunt, stories of a lost generation born into a fractured time.<BR> <BR><i>The Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway</i> presents many of Hemingway&rsquo;s most famous classics alongside rare and unpublished material: Hemingway&rsquo;s early drafts and correspondence, his dazzling out-of-print essay on the art of the short story, and two marvelous examples of his earliest work&#8212;his first published story, &ldquo;The Judgment of Manitou,&rdquo; which Hemingway wrote when still a high school student, and a never-before-published story, written when the author was recovering from a war injury in Milan after WWI. This work offers vital insight into the artistic development of one of the twentieth century&rsquo;s greatest writers. It is a perfect introduction for a new generation of Hemingway readers, and it belongs in the collection of any true Hemingway fan.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>The definitive short story collection that established Ernest Hemingway's literary reputation, originally published in 1938.</b><BR><BR>Ernest Hemingway is a cultural icon&#8212;an archetype of rugged masculinity, a romantic ideal of the intellectual in perpetual exile&#8212;but, to his countless readers, Hemingway remains a literary force much greater than his image. Of all of Hemingway&rsquo;s canonical fictions, perhaps none demonstrate so forcefully the power of the author&rsquo;s revolutionary style as his short stories. In classics like &ldquo;Hills like White Elephants,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Butterfly in the Tank,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber,&rdquo; Hemingway shows us great literature compressed to its most potent essentials. We also see, in Hemingway&rsquo;s short fiction, the tales that created the legend: these are stories of men and women in love and in war and on the hunt, stories of a lost generation born into a fractured time.<BR> <BR><i>The Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway</i> presents many of Hemingway&rsquo;s most famous classics alongside rare and unpublished material: Hemingway&rsquo;s early drafts and correspondence, his dazzling out-of-print essay on the art of the short story, and two marvelous examples of his earliest work&#8212;his first published story, &ldquo;The Judgment of Manitou,&rdquo; which Hemingway wrote when still a high school student, and a never-before-published story, written when the author was recovering from a war injury in Milan after WWI. This work offers vital insight into the artistic development of one of the twentieth century&rsquo;s greatest writers. It is a perfect introduction for a new generation of Hemingway readers, and it belongs in the collection of any true Hemingway fan.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[Before he gained wide fame as a novelist, Ernest Hemingway established his literary reputation with his short stories. Set in the varied landscapes of Spain, Africa, and the American Midwest, this definitive audio collection traces the development and maturation of Hemingway's distinct and revolutionary storytelling style -- from the plain bold language of this first story to his mastery of seamless prose that contained a spare, eloquent pathos, as well as a sense of expansive solitude. These stories showcase the singular talent of a master, the most important American writer of the twentieth century. <BR> <I>The Short Stories Volume III</I> features Stacy Keach reading such favorites as: <I>An Alpine Idyll, A Pursuit Race, Today is Friday, Banal Story, Now I Lay Me, After the Storm, A Clean, Well-lighted Place, The Light of the World, God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen, The Sea Change, A Way You'll Never Be, The Mother of the Queen, One Reader Writes, Homage to Switzerland, A Day's Wait, A Natural History of the Dead, Wine of Wyoming, The Gambler, The Nun, and the Radio,</I> and <I>Fathers and Sons.</I> <BR><BR> <B>ALL STORIES ARE UNABRIDGED</B>]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[Before he gained wide fame as a novelist, Ernest Hemingway established his literary reputation with his short stories. Set in the varied landscapes of Spain, Africa, and the American Midwest, this definitive audio collection traces the development and maturation of Hemingway's distinct and revolutionary storytelling style -- from the plain bald language of his first story to his mastery of seamless prose that contained a spare, eloquent pathos, as well as a sense of expansive solitude. These stories showcase the singular talent of a master, the most important American writer of the twentieth century.<BR><BR>The Short Stories Gift Edition features Stacy Keach reading such favorites as: <BR><i>The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber; The Snows of Kilimanjaro; The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife; The End of Something; My Old Man; Hills Like White Elephants; The Killers; Ten Indians; Now I Lay Me; A Clean, Well-lighted Place; A Way You'll Never Be; The Gambler;</i> and <i>Fathers and Sons.</i>]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[Ted Hammond loves a good mystery, and in the spring of his fifth-grade year, he's working on a big one. How can his school in the little town of Plattsford stay open next year if there are going to be only five students? Out here on the Great Plains, in western Nebraska, everyone understands that if you lose the school, you lose the town. But the mystery that has Ted's full attention at the moment is about that face, the face he sees in the upper window of the Andersons' house as he rides past on his paper route. The Andersons moved away two years ago, and their old farmhouse is empty and boarded up tight. At least it's supposed to be. <BR> <BR> A shrinking school in a dying town. A face in the window of an empty house. At first these facts don't seem to be related. But Ted Hammond learns that in a very small town, there's no such thing as an isolated event. And the solution of one mystery is often the beginning of another.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b><big>Discussion Topics</big></b> <BR> What do the opening pages of the novel tell readers about Ted's daily routine, his town, and his feelings about both? What is different about the morning on which the story begins? <BR> Describe the Red Prairie Learning Center. How is it similar to, or different from, your school? Would you like to go to school in Plattsford? Why or why not? <BR> How does Ted's love of mysteries affect his investigation of the face in the farmhouse window? Was he correct in going to the farmhouse alone? <BR> How have April and her family come to be hiding in the farmhouse? Do you think April is making a good choice to hide there? Explain your answer. <BR> How does being a Boy Scout affect Ted's actions? Given the situation, can Ted act honestly toward everyone -- April, his family, Ruby Cantrell at the E&A Market, Mrs. Mitchell -- at the same time? Have you ever found that keeping a secret for one person required you to behave dishonestly toward another? How did this make you feel? How did you solve your dilemma? <BR> How has Mrs. Mitchell made her small schoolhouse situation work? What are he concerns for the Red Prairie Learning Center's future? How does Mrs. Mitchell's home life affect her concerns? Compare Mrs. Mitchell's situation to Mr. Hammond's outlook for his farm. What similarities or differences do you note? <BR> Why does Ted tell his secret to Mrs. Mitchell? How does she feel about keeping Ted's confidence? What does she do? How does Ted feel about her actions? <BR> What happens when Ted discovers April's family gone from the Anderson farmhouse? What was Deputy Linwood really investigating? What does this confusion suggest about keeping secrets? Where does Ted find April? <BR> What does Ted decide is the best way to help April and her family? To whom does he reach out for help? What effects do his actions have upon his town? <BR> Is Ted ultimately able to help April? How do the efforts of his town ultimately help others? How does this, in turn, help Plattsford? <BR> Describe ways in which your school, religious, or civic groups reach out to others. Have you ever participated in such efforts? How did this make you feel? Why is it important for communities to offer help to those in need? <BR> Imagine you are Ted as a senior in high school. Looking back, how might you describe your Room One mystery experience? What is the most important thing you learned? <BR> <b><big>Activities and Research</big></b> <BR> Write a letter to Ted recommending a mystery novel. Explain why you think he will enjoy the book and whether or not you think he can solve the case before the final page. If desired, share your recommendation with friends or classmates. <BR> Create a class survey about jobs. How many students have jobs? Do students plan to get jobs and at what age? What jobs would they like to try? How many students have daily chores at home? How many receive allowances? Compile the results of your survey into a short report, including graphs or tables. <BR> On a two-columned chart, compare Ted's school to your own. Consider the building, class size, daily routines and other observations. In small groups, research different ways kids are educated, from public schools to homeschooling. Use your research for a classroom debate on the best types of learning settings. <BR> In the character of April, write a series of journal entries describing: how you feel when you spot Ted through the window; why you decide to tell Ted your story; your feelings about losing your dad in the war; your concerns about your mother; your feelings just before leaving Plattsford. <BR> In the character of Mrs. Mitchell, list the pros and cons of keeping Ted's secret. Discuss your list with friends or classmates. Vote to see whether most kids agree or disagree with Mrs. Mitchell's actions. Ask students to explain their votes. <BR> Go online to learn more about the Boy Scouts (www.scouting.org) and/or Girl Scouts (www.girlscouts.org). Then write a short essay describing scouting values and conduct codes, or about other groups or organizations to which you belong that have a strong impact on your behavior. <BR> With friends or classmates, role-play one of the following conversations from the novel: Ted telling April about his plan to help her family; Mrs. Mitchell asking Superintendant Seward not to close Red Prairie Learning Center; Plattsford residents telling television reporters about trying to help April and her family. <BR> Create an imaginary blog for Red Prairie Learning Center. What would you call your blog? Write a series of postings in the character of Ted, Mrs. Mitchell, and other students in the classroom. What links might the group suggest offering? How might Ted's encounter with April affect the content of the blog?]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>The definitive edition of the classic novel of love during wartime, featuring all of the alternate endings: &ldquo;Fascinating&hellip;serves as an artifact of a bygone craft, with handwritten notes and long passages crossed out, giving readers a sense of an author&rsquo;s process&rdquo; (<i>The New York Times</i>).</b><BR><BR>Written when Ernest Hemingway was thirty years old and lauded as the best American novel to emerge from World War I, <I>A Farewell to Arms </I>is the unforgettable story of an American ambulance driver on the Italian front and his passion for a beautiful English nurse. Set against the looming horrors of the battlefield&#8212;weary, demoralized men marching in the rain during the German attack on Caporetto; the profound struggle between loyalty and desertion&#8212;this gripping, semiautobiographical work captures the harsh realities of war and the pain of lovers caught in its inexorable sweep. <BR><BR>Ernest Hemingway famously said that he rewrote the ending to <I>A Farewell to Arms </I>thirty-nine times to get the words right. This edition collects all of the alternative endings together for the first time, along with early drafts of other essential passages, offering new insight into Hemingway&#8217;s craft and creative process and the evolution of one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century. Featuring Hemingway&#8217;s own 1948 introduction to an illustrated reissue of the novel, a personal foreword by the author&#8217;s son Patrick Hemingway, and a new introduction by the author&#8217;s grandson Se&#225;n Hemingway, this edition of <I>A Farewell to Arms </I>is truly a celebration.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[Reading Group Guide for <I>A Farewell to Arms</I> <BR> <B>Introduction</B> <BR> Ernest Hemingway was born July 21, 1899, in Oak Park, Illinois. After graduation from high school, he moved to Kansas City, Missouri, where he worked briefly for the <I>Kansas City Star.</I> Failing to qualify for the United States Army because of poor eyesight, he enlisted with the American Red Cross to drive ambulances in Italy. He was severely wounded on the Austrian front on July 9, 1918. Following recuperation in a Milan hospital, he returned home and became a freelance writer for the <I>Toronto Star.</I> <BR> In December of 1921, he sailed to France and joined an expatriate community of writers and artists in Paris while continuing to write for the <I>Toronto Star.</I> There his fiction career began in "little magazines" and small presses and led to a volume of short stories, <I>In Our Time</I> (1925). His novels <I>The Sun Also Rises</I> (1926) and <I>A Farewell to Arms</I> (1929) established Hemingway as the most important and influential fiction writer of his generation. His later collections of short stories and <I>For Whom the Bell Tolls</I> (1940) affirmed his extraordinary career while his highly publicized life gave him unrivaled celebrity as a literary figure. <BR> Hemingway became an authority on the subjects of his art: trout fishing, bullfighting, big-game hunting, and deep-sea fishing, and the cultures of the regions in which he set his work -- France, Italy, Spain, Cuba, and Africa. <BR> <I>The Old Man and the Sea</I> (1952) earned him the Pulitzer Prize and was instrumental in his being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1954. Hemingway died in Ketchum, Idaho, on July 2, 1961. <BR> <B>Description</B> <BR> Lieutenant Frederic Henry, an American assigned to a Red Cross ambulance unit in Italy, is severely wounded on the Austrian front and sent to a hospital in Milan, where he falls in love with his English nurse, Catherine Barkley. When he returns to the front, the war goes badly, and Frederic joins a retreat from Caporetto in which he barely escapes execution at the hands of Italian battle police. He deserts the army, returns to Milan, goes on to Stresa, joins now-pregnant Catherine Barkley, and avoids capture by rowing across the lake to Switzerland, where they live an idyllic life until Catherine delivers a still-born child and dies, and Frederic walks back to his hotel in the rain, alone. <BR> <B>Discussion Questions</B> <BR> 1. How does the first chapter of <I>A Farewell to Arms</I> set a tone and mood which anticipate subsequent events? Why does the narrator move the reader through a change of seasons from late summer to autumn and on to winter? What are the major images in the chapter, and what is the effect of the understatement in the final sentence (p. 4)? <BR> 2. During Lt. Frederic Henry's early visits with Catherine Barkley, Catherine says as they touch each other and speak of love, "This is a rotten game we play, isn't it"? (p. 31). How should one characterize Frederic's early "love" for Catherine? What does the initial stage of their relationship reveal about the effect of the war upon their lives? <BR> 3. What perspective regarding love does the priest from Abruzzi provide, and why do officers bait him during meals? Frederic says the priest "had always known what I did not know and what, when I learned it, I was always able to forget. But I did not know that then, although I learned it later" (p. 14). Is Frederic's observation borne out in the novel? <BR> 4. Why are the Italian soldiers disillusioned with the war? How is Frederic's leap into the river to escape the battle police a symbolic demarcation in the novel? What extended meaning do we find in his statement, "It was not my show any more..."(p. 232)? Does Catherine represent for Frederic refuge, peace, and "home" in its fullest sense? How? <BR> 5. Is <I>A Farewell to Arms</I> "a study in doom," as it has sometimes been called? How is Frederic's recollection of the ants on the burning log relevant to questions about God and faith raised in the novel? What do you believe Frederic has learned, or perhaps become resigned to, in this novel of love and war? <BR> <BR> <B>After Reading the Novel</B> <BR> The critic Allen Tate read <I>A Farewell to Arms</I> in Paris in 1929 and called it a masterpiece. Fewer than three months after its publication it had sold 45,000 copies and headed many bestseller lists. Many consider it Hemingway's best novel. You may wish to look at early sketches which inspired portions of <I>A Farewell to Arms,</I> especially the "Miniatures" which introduce Chapters 6 and 7 of <I>In Our Time,</I> or at short stories which evolved from Hemingway's World War I experiences such as "In Another Country" (1927), "Now I Lay Me" (1927), and "A Way You'll Never Be" (1933), all available in <I>The Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway.</I> Since the rise of feminist criticism, much has been written about Hemingway's female characters, especially Catherine Barkley, whom some reject as unflatteringly submissive. There is considerable division over this issue, and the subject is worthy of exploration. A 1957 Hollywood movie version of <I>A Farewell to Arms</I> stars Rock Hudson and Jennifer Jones. A more recent film, loosely based upon Hemingway's war experiences in Italy, starring Chris O'Donnell and Sandra Bullock, is also available.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>Ernest Hemingway's masterpiece on war, love, loyalty, and honor tells the story of Robert Jordan, an antifascist American fighting in the Spanish Civil War.</b><BR><BR>In 1937 Ernest Hemingway traveled to Spain to cover the civil war there for the North American Newspaper Alliance. Three years later he completed the greatest novel to emerge from &ldquo;the good fight&rdquo; and one of the foremost classics of war literature.<BR> <BR><i>For Whom the Bell Tolls </i>tells of loyalty and courage, love and defeat, and the tragic death of an ideal. Robert Jordan, a young American in the International Brigades, is attached to an antifascist guerilla unit in the mountains of Spain. In his portrayal of Jordan&rsquo;s love for the beautiful Maria and his superb account of a guerilla leader&rsquo;s last stand, Hemingway creates a work at once rare and beautiful, strong and brutal, compassionate, moving, and wise. Greater in power, broader in scope, and more intensely emotional than any of the author&rsquo;s previous works, <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls </i>stands as one of the best war novels ever written.]]></d104>

Following recuperation in a Milan hospital, he returned home and became a freelance writer for the <I>Toronto Star.</I> <BR> In December of 1921, he sailed to France and joined an expatriate community of writers and artists in Paris while continuing to write for the <I>Toronto Star.</I> There his fiction career began in "little magazines" and small presses and led to a volume of short stories, <I>In Our Time</I> (1925). His novels <I>The Sun Also Rises</I> (1926) and <I>A Farewell to Arms</I> (1929) established Hemingway as the most important and influential fiction writer of his generation. His later collections of short stories and <I>For Whom the Bell Tolls</I> (1940) affirmed his extraordinary career while his highly publicized life gave him unrivaled celebrity as a literary figure. <BR> Hemingway became an authority on the subjects of his art: trout fishing, bullfighting, big-game hunting, and deep-sea fishing, and the cultures of the regions in which he set his work -- France, Italy, Spain, Cuba, and Africa. <BR> <I>The Old Man and the Sea</I> (1952) earned him the Pulitzer Prize and was instrumental in his being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1954. Hemingway died in Ketchum, Idaho, on July 2, 1961. <BR> <B>Description</B> <BR> Robert Jordan, a Spanish professor from Montana serving with Loyalist guerrilla forces during the Spanish Civil War, is guided by the old man Anselmo to Pablo's guerrilla band in the mountains above a bridge which Jordan must blow up when the Loyalist offensive begins. Pablo, aware that Jordan's mission will invite fascist forces, refuses at first to participate, but relents, returning with additional men and horses shortly before the mission begins. Knowing that the fascists are aware of the offensive, Jordan sends a message to General Golz, hoping the offensive will be canceled, but the message arrives too late. Jordan blows the bridge, and Anselmo is killed by flying steel. As the group attempts escape, Jordan is seriously injured, and Maria, having been told by Jordan that he will always be with her, leaves with the survivors while Jordan remains behind, waiting for death. <BR> <B>Discussion Questions</B> <BR> 1. Is Pablo opposed to blowing the bridge because he is a coward, as Pilar says, or is Pablo, himself, correct when he says he "has a tactical sense"? Why does Jordan agree with Pablo's reference to "the seriousness of this" (p. 54)? Is Agust&#237;n correct when he calls Pablo "very smart" (p. 94)? <BR> 2. Was the communist effort to eliminate God successful? What does Anselmo's view of killing suggest about the limitations of dogma? What does he mean when he says of the bridge sentries, "It is only orders that come between us" (pp. 192-193)? What is implied when Anselmo says soldiers should atone and cleanse themselves after the war? <BR> 3. "Time" is a major theme in <I>For Whom the Bell Tolls.</I> How does Pilar's awareness of time affect her attitude toward Robert Jordan's and Maria's relationship? What conclusions does Robert Jordan draw about his own life during the very short time he spends with Maria? <BR> 4. Pablo calls his compatriots "illusioned people" (p. 215). Does this remark prove to be true? Does Jordan expose illusions? Does <I>For Whom the Bell Tolls</I> suggest that because of their illusions and vulnerability to exploitation the victims of the war were the entire Spanish people? <BR> 5. Does the epigraph, an excerpt from John Donne's <I>Devotions XVII,</I> convey the theme of <I>For Whom the Bell Tolls?</I> What is that theme? What scenes in the novel develop the sentiment of the epigraph? What is the narrator telling us when he says that Robert Jordan, lying on the forest floor waiting for death, is "completely integrated" (p. 471)? <BR> <BR> <B>After Reading the Novel</B> <BR> To read <I>For Whom The Bell Tolls</I> is to experience Hemingway's most compelling assertion of his role as an artist. Writing in a time of war and of passionate partisans, he chose truth once more, and he chose as well aesthetic principles over propaganda. Your group might enjoy Hemingway's Spanish Civil War dispatches written prior to <I>For Whom the Bell Tolls.</I> They are available in <I>By-Line: Ernest Hemingway</I> (Touchstone Books) and provide clues to Hemingway's process of composition. You might also want to compare <I>The Fifth Column,</I> Hemingway's play about the Spanish Civil War, to the novel and draw conclusions as to why the play did not succeed as did the novel. <I>The Spanish Earth,</I> a Loyalist film which Hemingway helped make, is not readily available: however, it can be obtained, usually from your public, college, or university library. Although it is propagandistic, it does provide battlefield scenes along with Hemingway's sound-track comments. A Hollywood movie of <I>For Whom the Bell Tolls</I> stars Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[Reading Group Guide for <I>The Old Man and the Sea</I> <BR> <B>Introduction</B> <BR> Ernest Hemingway was born July 21, 1899, in Oak Park, Illinois. After graduation from high school, he moved to Kansas City, Missouri, where he worked briefly for the <I>Kansas City Star.</I> Failing to qualify for the United States Army because of poor eyesight, he enlisted with the American Red Cross to drive ambulances in Italy. He was severely wounded on the Austrian front on July 9, 1918. Following recuperation in a Milan hospital, he returned home and became a freelance writer for the <I>Toronto Star.</I> <BR> In December of 1921, he sailed to France and joined an expatriate community of writers and artists in Paris while continuing to write for the <I>Toronto Star.</I> There his fiction career began in "little magazines" and small presses and led to a volume of short stories, <I>In Our Time</I> (1925). His novels <I>The Sun Also Rises</I> (1926) and <I>A Farewell to Arms</I> (1929) established Hemingway as the most important and influential fiction writer of his generation. His later collections of short stories and <I>For Whom the Bell Tolls</I> (1940) affirmed his extraordinary career while his highly publicized life gave him unrivaled celebrity as a literary figure. <BR> Hemingway became an authority on the subjects of his art: trout fishing, bullfighting, big-game hunting, and deep-sea fishing, and the cultures of the regions in which he set his work -- France, Italy, Spain, Cuba, and Africa. <BR> <I>The Old Man and the Sea</I> (1952) earned him the Pulitzer Prize and was instrumental in his being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1954. Hemingway died in Ketchum, Idaho, on July 2, 1961. <BR> <B>Description</B> <BR> Santiago, an old Cuban fisherman who has not caught a fish for eighty-four days, goes far out to sea in his skiff alone because the young boy Manolin, who has fished with him and served him in the past, is prevented from continuing to do so by his parents, who are convinced that the old man has <I>salao,</I> bad luck. Santiago kills a giant marlin after fighting it for three days, lashes it alongside his skiff, and sails for home only to have his fish attacked by sharks during the night and devoured despite the old man's valiant efforts to kill them or drive them away. The morning after Santiago's return Manolin finds the old man sleeping in his palm shack, cries, brings him coffee, and pledges to replace lost equipment and to fish with him again, for there is much that he can learn. When the boy leaves, the old man is dreaming of lions on a beach which he saw in Africa in his youth from a square-rigged ship. <BR> <B>Discussion Questions</B> <BR> 1. What is suggested when Manolin says to Santiago that his father "hasn't much faith" (p. 10) but that he, himself, "would like to serve in some way" (p. 12)? Does this offer of Manolin's asking to throw the "cast net" (p. 16) echo the Bible and underscore the boy's respect for Santiago? Why is Santiago so worthy of Manolin's respect? <BR> 2. Why is the boy so important to Santiago? Despite his bad luck, Santiago's hope and confidence remain, even "freshening as when the breeze rises" (p. 13) as the boy helps him prepare for his next fishing trip. What does this statement indicate about the role Manolin plays in Santiago's life? Could "the boy" be regarded as a metaphor? How? <BR> 3. Like other Hemingway characters, Santiago is very much alone, "beyond all people in the world" (p. 50); yet he says, "No man was ever alone on the sea" (p. 61). Why? Does he feel joined with the creatures and universe or strengthened and sustained by them in any way? Do his dreams of the lions or reflections about his earlier strength support him? <BR> 4. Although determined to kill the fish, Santiago says that he loves and respects it, and on the third day of his struggle he says, "Never have I seen a greater, or more beautiful, or a calmer or more noble thing than you, brother. Come on and kill me. I do not care who kills who" (p. 92). Is Santiago ennobled by his fight? Does it define his character? <BR> 5. How does the story of Santiago confirm the presence of two themes prevalent in Hemingway's fiction: "the undefeated" and "winner take nothing"? Santiago says, "A man can be destroyed but not defeated." Do you agree? Can the novella be read as an allegory, a story with levels of meanings? Is it merely Santiago's story, or our story also? <BR> <BR> <B>After Reading the Novel</B> <BR> <I>The Old Man and the Sea</I> was acknowledged as a masterpiece even before its publication, and <I>Life</I> magazine took the unprecedented step of publishing the entire text in its September, 1, 1953, issue, which sold over 5 million copies in two days. Since its first appearance, the novella has continued to affect readers of all ages profoundly. It has never been out of print. Two film versions of the novella have been produced, the first involving Hemingway's participation, which stars Spencer Tracy, and a more recent version starring Anthony Quinn. In 1999 IMAX is releasing worldwide its animated movie of <I>The Old Man and the Sea.</I> Hemingway's <I>Esquire</I> "fictionalized" non-fiction articles (1933-1936): "Marlin Off the Morro: A Cuban Newsletter" (1933); "Out in the Stream: A Cuban Letter" (1933); and "On the Blue Water: A Gulf Stream Letter" (1936), which contains the old fisherman sketch that was the inspiration for the novella, are available in <I>By-Line: Ernest Hemingway</I> (Touchstone Books). These articles display Hemingway's considerable knowledge of big-game fishing, in particular the marlin, the subjects about which he would write in <I>The Old Man and the Sea.</I>]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>Ernest Hemingway&rsquo;s classic memoir of Paris in the 1920s, now available in a restored edition, includes the original manuscript along with insightful recollections and unfinished sketches.</b><BR><BR>Published posthumously in 1964, <i>A Moveable Feast</i> remains one of Ernest Hemingway&rsquo;s most enduring works. Since Hemingway&rsquo;s personal papers were released in 1979, scholars have examined the changes made to the text before publication. Now, this special restored edition presents the original manuscript as the author prepared it to be published.<BR> <BR>Featuring a personal foreword by Patrick Hemingway, Ernest&rsquo;s sole surviving son, and an introduction by grandson of the author, Se&#225;n Hemingway, editor of this edition, the book also includes a number of unfinished, never-before-published Paris sketches revealing experiences that Hemingway had with his son, Jack, and his first wife Hadley. Also included are irreverent portraits of literary luminaries, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ford Maddox Ford, and insightful recollections of Hemingway&rsquo;s own early experiments with his craft.<BR> <BR>Widely celebrated and debated by critics and readers everywhere, the restored edition of <i>A Moveable Feast </i>brilliantly evokes the exuberant mood of Paris after World War I and the unbridled creativity and unquenchable enthusiasm that Hemingway himself epitomized.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>From one of the best writers in American literature, a classic novel about smuggling, intrigue, and love.</b><BR><BR><i>To Have and Have Not</i> is the dramatic story of Harry Morgan, an honest man who is forced into running contraband between Cuba and Key West as a means of keeping his crumbling family financially afloat. His adventures lead him into the world of the wealthy and dissipated yachtsmen who throng the region and involve him in a strange and unlikely love affair.<BR> <BR>In this harshly realistic, yet oddly tender and wise novel, Hemingway perceptively delineates the personal struggles of both the "haves" and the "have nots" and creates one of the most subtle and moving portraits of a love affair in his oeuvre. By turns funny and tragic, lively and poetic, remarkable in its emotional impact, <i>To Have and Have Not</i> is literary high adventure at its finest.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>A poignant tale of a revitalizing love that is found too late&#8212;the fleeting connection between an Italian countess and an injured American colonel inspires light and hope, while only darkness lies ahead.</b><BR><BR>In the fall of 1948, Ernest Hemingway made his first extended visit to Italy in thirty years. His reacquaintance with Venice, a city he loved, provided the inspiration for <i>Across the River and into the Trees,</i> the story of Richard Cantwell, a war-ravaged American colonel stationed in Italy at the close of the Second World War, and his love for a young Italian countess.<BR> <BR>A bittersweet homage to love that overpowers reason, to the resilience of the human spirit, and to the world-weary beauty and majesty of Venice, <i>Across the River and into the Trees</i> stands as Hemingway's statement of defiance in response to the great dehumanizing atrocities of the Second World War.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>Winner of the 2007 Audie Award for Solo Narration&#8212;Female and Finalist for Fiction, Unabridged</b><BR><BR>From the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <i>Lonesome Dove</i> comes a big, brilliant, unputdownable saga of the Old West, told in the spunky courageous voice of a young woman named Nellie Courtright.<BR><BR>When twenty-two-year-old Nellie Courtright and her teenage brother Jackson are unexpectedly orphaned by their father&#8217;s suicide on his new and unprosperous ranch, they make their way to the nearby town of Rita Blanca, where Jackson manages to secure a job as a sheriff's deputy, while Nellie, ever resourceful, becomes the town&#8217;s telegrapher.<BR> <BR>Together, they inadvertently put Rita Blanca on the map when young Jackson succeeds in shooting down all six of the ferocious Yazee brothers in a gunfight that brings him lifelong fame but which he can never repeat because his success came purely out of luck.<BR> <BR>Propelled by her own energy and commonsense approach to life, Nellie meets and almost conquers the heart of Buffalo Bill, the man she will love most in her long life, and goes on to meet, and witness the exploits of, Billy the Kid, the Earp brothers, and Doc Holliday. She even gets a ringside seat at the Battle at the O.K. Corral, the most famous gunfight in Western history, and eventually lives long enough to see the West and its gunfighters turned into movies.<BR> <BR>Full of life, love, shootouts, real Western heroes and villains, <i>Telegraph Days</i> is Larry McMurtry at his epic best.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>Both a revealing self-portrait and dramatic fictional chronicle of his final African safari, Ernest Hemingway's last unpublished work was written when he returned from Kenya in 1953. Edited by his son Patrick, who accompanied his father on the safari, <i>True at First Light</i> offers rare insights into the legendary American writer.</b><BR><BR>A blend of autobiography and fiction, the book opens on the day his close friend Pop, a celebrated hunter, leaves Ernest in charge of the safari camp and news arrives of a potential attack from a hostile tribe. Drama continues to build as his wife, Mary, pursues the great black-maned lion that has become her obsession, and Ernest becomes involved with a young African girl whom he supposedly plans to take as a second bride. Increasingly enchanted by the local African community, he struggles between the attraction of these two women and the wildly different cultures they represent.<BR> <BR>Spicing his depictions of human longings with sharp humor, Hemingway captures the excitement of big-game hunting and the unparalleled beauty of the landscape. Rich in laughter, beauty, and profound insight. <i>True at First Light</i> is an extraordinary publishing event&#8212;a breathtaking final work from one of our most beloved and important writers.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<B>READING GROUP GUIDE</B> <BR> <B>QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION</B> <BR> 1) Hemingway completed just one draft of <I>True at First Light,</I> and after his death it remained under lock and key for decades. Did these circumstances affect the way you read the book? How should <I>True at First Light</I> be judged within Hemingway's complete canon of work? If he had finished writing and editing book himself, in what ways might it have been different? <BR> 2) Perhaps the most controversial aspect of <I>True at First Light</I> is Hemingway's purported "marriage" to Debba. Do you believe that this relationship is truthfully rendered, or one of the "fictionalized" elements of this memoir? Could Debba be an amalgamation of a few different women? A metaphor for Hemingway's love of Africa itself? <BR> 3) On the surface, Hemingway perpetuates the notion that he and Mary are very happy. They frequently take great pains to reassure one another that they are content. Are they trying to convince themselves they are still in love? If so, why? Is their bickering a sign that they are unhappy, or is this just the way they communicate? Discuss his assertion that "love is a terrible thing...[and] fidelity does not exist nor ever is implied except at the first marriage" (282). <BR> 4) Hemingway often mocks the white man's presence in Africa, noting how many are willing to pay inflated prices for an authentic African hunt, and even joking that a Hilton should be built for the comfort of such people. Does Hemingway despise these casual hunters and the changes they bring to Africa? Does he realize that, in the eyes of many, he himself is one of those people? How does he feel about his own role as an outsider in Africa, and the impact of his own presence there? Does he become more aware of it as the novel progresses? <BR> 5) The Informer is one of the book's most interesting characters, universally despised by nearly everyone but Hemingway. Why is the author so charitable to the Informer? What does this character represent to Hemingway and to the others at camp? Is the information he gives Hemingway useful in any real way? Discuss Hemingway's observation that the Informer will "betray anyone betrayable" for money (38). <BR> 6) Hemingway says, "A writer of fiction is really a congenital liar who invents from his own knowledge or that of other men. I am a writer of fiction and so I am a liar too...I make the truth as I invent it truer than it would be" (100). In what way is Hemingway&#213;s fiction truer than real life? And if "the truth as [he] invents it is truer than it would be" then why does he call himself a liar? Is a writer of fiction ever obligated to tell the absolute truth? What does Hemingway mean when he says that "in Africa a thing is true at first light and a lie by noon?" <BR> 7) Hemingway refers to "having a conscience" about hunting. Is such a thing possible when you are hunting at least partly for sport? Is hunting more noble if you stick to the rules? <BR> 8) Reread Hemingway's description of the killing of Mary's lion (179), and the subsequent examination of his body. Does his rendering of the details glorify the violence, sadness, and ultimate indignity of the event -- or the opposite? Compare it to the scene where Hemingway must put down his favorite horse, Old Kite (224). How does this description differ from his descriptions of hunting? <BR> 9) Does Mary appreciate how much danger she puts everyone in every day so that she can kill the lion? Why is she so melancholy after she accomplishes her goal? Is she truly disappointed in the way the hunt played out, or is she experiencing a predictable emotional letdown? Does she feel guilty for killing something so beautiful, or feel a true sadness at its destruction? <BR> 10) Hemingway laments throughout the narrative that Debba is "losing her impudence." What does he mean by this? Are the changes in Debba a result of her relationship with Hemingway? If Debba is a symbol of Hemingway's desire to truly be a part of Africa, then do the changes in Debba symbolize the changes outsiders like Hemingway are bringing to the land? <BR> 11) Debba and Mary are two starkly different women from different worlds. Compare Mary's Nairobi shopping excursion with Debba's shopping trip with Hemingway. What does each trip mean to each woman? How does their individual behavior and attitude express their inherent differences as people? How does Hemingway's love for Debba differ from his love for Mary? Is it possible to be in love with two people at once? <BR> 12) While reading <I>True at First Light,</I> it is difficult to know when Hemingway is telling the truth, and when he has fictionalized his story. By altering details and creating new stories, is he proving that writers have the power the blur the line between what is real and what is imaginary -- and sometimes even rewrite history? <BR> 13) How does Hemingway use humor to get his point across in <I>True at First Light?</I> Was this book funnier than you expected it to be? How much of it is a parody of Hemingway himself? <BR> 14) Discuss Hemingways' choice to be in Kenya at this particular time, given the dangerous political situation. Did the looming danger in the region make the trip more exciting for them? Can you recall any scene where Hemingway himself displays violent tendencies? Does he ever exhibit the mercenary behavior plaguing the region at this time? <BR> 15) The Hemingways are in no hurry to leave Africa and go back to their "real world." What are they trying to escape? Is Hemingway hiding from his celebrity, which is mentioned only rarely by those in his hunting group? Both Mary and Hemingway say they wish they could stay in Africa forever. What's stopping them from doing just that? <BR> 16) Discuss how Hemingway's new "religion" scorns the organized religions of the world and the Christian missionaries at work in Africa. What are the requirements of his self-made faith? When asked to describe it, Hemingway says "we retain the best of various other sects and tribal law and customs. But we weld them into a whole that all can believe." How is this different from the organized religions he rejects?]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>The <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Jude Deveraux brings a &ldquo;wonderful addition&rdquo; (<i>Booklist</i>) to her Montgomery/Taggert Family series with this supernatural romance in which, with the help of a feisty ghost, a man uncovers the secrets that led to the tragic death of his fianc&#233;e.</b><BR><BR>After three years, Jace Montgomery is still grieving over his fianc&#233;e Stacy&rsquo;s mysterious suicide. He hasn&rsquo;t been interested in another woman since her passing, and her family still blames him for her death. <BR> <BR>While flipping through one of her old paperbacks, Jace discovers a photo of a house stuck between the pages, bearing the cryptic message: &ldquo;Ours again. Together forever. See you there.&rdquo; The note was dated the day before her death. Obsessed by the possibility of understanding her suicide, Jace seeks out the property&#8212;Priory House, a big brick fortress in Margate, England&#8212;and buys it. <BR> <BR>It doesn&rsquo;t take long to learn that the house is haunted by a headstrong and feisty ghost, Ann Stuart, whom he must tangle with if he&rsquo;s ever to solve the mystery. Ann died under circumstances similar to those of his late fianc&#233;e, and he has a hunch that there is a connection between the two. Through his own investigations and with the help of a beautiful foreign correspondent, Jace is forced to reconcile his fianc&#233;e&rsquo;s life and her death. What follows is a satisfying and seductive discovery of both time and love by one of America&rsquo;s favorite storytellers.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[In this tale of high-spirited and terrifying adventure, set against the background of the West that Larry McMurtry has made his own, <i>By Sorrow&#8217;s River</i> is an epic in its own right, with an extraordinary young woman as its leading figure.<BR><BR>At the heart of this third volume of his Western saga remains the beautiful and determined Tasmin Berrybender, now married to the &#8220;Sin Killer&#8221; and mother to their young son, Monty. <i>By Sorrow&#8217;s River</i> continues the Berrybender party&#8217;s trail across the endless Great Plains of the West toward Santa Fe, where they intend, those who are lucky enough to survive the journey, to spend the winter. They meet up with a vast array of characters from the history of the West: Kit Carson, the famous scout; Le Partezon, the fearsome Sioux war chief; two aristocratic Frenchmen whose eccentric aim is to cross the Great Plains by hot air balloon; a party of slavers; a band of raiding Pawnee; and many other astonishing characters who prove, once again, that the rolling, grassy plains are not, in fact, nearly as empty of life as they look. Most of what is there is dangerous and hostile, even when faced with Tasmin&#8217;s remarkable, frosty sangfroid. She is one of the strongest and most interesting of Larry McMurtry&#8217;s women characters, and is at the center of this powerful and ambitious novel of the West.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[From Pulitzer Prize-winning author Larry McMurtry comes the first in a four-volume epic journey through the early American frontier, featuring the Berrybender family, English nobility adrift in the American West in the 1830s.<BR><BR>It is 1830, and the Berrybender family&#8212;rich, aristocratic, English, and hopelessly out of place&#8212;is on its way up the Missouri River to see the untamed West as it begins to open up. With irascible determination&#8212;and a great deal of outright chaos&#8212;the party experiences both the awesome majesty and brutal savagery of the unexplored land, from buffalo stampedes and natural disasters to Indian raids and encounters with frontiersmen and trappers, explorers, pioneers, and one part-time preacher known as "the Sin Killer." Packed with breathtaking adventure, charming romance, and a sense of humor stretching clear over the horizon, Sin Killer is a truly unique view of the West that could only come from the boundless skill and imagination of Larry McMurtry.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[In <I>The Wandering Hill,</I> Larry McMurtry continues the story of Tasmin Berrybender and her family in the unexplored Wild West of the 1830s, at that point in time when Lewis and Clark are still a living memory, and when the clash between the powerful Indian tribes of the Missouri and the encroaching white Americans is about to turn into full-blown tragedy. <BR> Amidst all this, the Berrybender family -- English, eccentric, wealthy, and fiercely out of place -- continues their journey of exploration, although beset by difficulties, tragedies, and the increasing hardships of day-to-day survival. <BR> Abandoning their luxurious steamer, which is stuck in the ice near the Knife River, they make their way overland to the confluence of the Missouri and the Yellowstone. Tasmin is about to become a mother, living with the elusive young mountain man Jim Snow. Theirs is a great love affair, lived out in conditions of great risk. <BR> From the murder of the iced-in steamship's crew to the appearance of the Partezon, a particularly blood-thirsty Sioux warrior with a band of over two hundred, <I>The Wandering Hill</I> is at once literature on a grand scale and riveting entertainment by a master storyteller.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[In this brilliant saga&#8212;the final volume of The Berrybender Narratives and an epic in its own right&#8212;Larry McMurtry lives up to his reputation for delivering novels with &#8220;wit, grace, and more than a hint of what might be called muscular nostalgia, fit together to create a panoramic portrait of the American West&#8221; (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>).<BR><BR>As this finale opens, Tasmin and her family are under irksome, though comfortable, arrest in Mexican Santa Fe. Her father, the eccentric Lord Berrybender, is planning to head for Texas with his whole family and his retainers, English, American, and Native American. Tasmin, who would once have followed her husband, Jim Snow, anywhere, is no longer even sure she likes him, or knows where to go to next. Neither does anyone else&#8212;even Captain Clark, of Lewis and Clark fame, is puzzled by the great changes sweeping over the West, replacing red men and buffalo with towns and farms.<BR> <BR>In the meantime, Jim Snow, accompanied by Kit Carson, journeys to New Orleans, where he meets up with a muscular black giant named Juppy, who turns out to be one of Lord Berrybender&#8217;s many illegitimate offspring, and in whose company they make their way back to Santa Fe. But even they are unable to prevent the Mexicans from carrying the Berrybender family on a long and terrible journey across the desert to Vera Cruz.<BR> <BR>Starving, dying of thirst, and in constant, bloody battle with slavers pursuing them, the Berrybenders finally make their way to civilization&#8212;if New Orleans of the time can be called that&#8212;where Jim Snow has to choose between Tasmin and the great American plains, on which he has lived all his life in freedom, and where, after all her adventures, Tasmin must finally decide where her future lies.<BR> <BR>With a cast of characters that includes almost every major real-life figure of the West, <i>Folly and Glory</i> is a novel that represents the culmination of a great and unique four-volume saga of the early days of the West; it is one of Larry McMurtry&#8217;s finest achievements.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b><i>New York Times</i> bestseller Linda Howard brings scintillating sensuality and high-voltage thrills to this novel following a painter as she embarks on a sizzling romance while also coming under suspicion for a shocking murder.</b><BR><BR>A talented painter in her early thirties, Paris Sweeney has achieved enviable success: her work sells at an exclusive New York City gallery, and her popularity is at an all-time high. Life is good, and Sweeney, as she prefers to be called, is content.<BR> <BR>But lately, Sweeney&rsquo;s dreams seem to echo a growing restlessness that has taken hold of her. Suddenly, impulsively, Sweeney falls into a night of intense passion with millionaire Richard Worth. Now, the true dangers of her all-consuming urges are about to be revealed where Sweeney least expects it: in her paintings.<BR> <BR>After a creative frenzy she can barely recall, Sweeney discovers she has rendered a disturbing image&#8212;a graphic murder scene. Against her better instincts, she returns to the canvas time and again, filling out each chilling detail piece by piece. But when a shattering, real-life murder mirrors her creation, Sweeney falls under suspicion. With every stroke of her brush, she risks incriminating herself with her inexplicable knowledge of a deadly crime. And every desire&#8212;including her hunger for Richard&#8212;is loaded with uncertainty as Sweeney races to unmask a killer.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>A national bestseller, <i>Authentic Happiness</i> launched the revolutionary new science of Positive Psychology&#8212;and sparked a coast-to-coast debate on the nature of real happiness.</b><BR><BR>According to esteemed psychologist and bestselling author Martin Seligman, happiness is not the result of good genes or luck. Real, lasting happiness comes from focusing on one&rsquo;s personal strengths rather than weaknesses&#8212;and working with them to improve all aspects of one&rsquo;s life. Using practical exercises, brief tests, and a dynamic website program, Seligman shows readers how to identify their highest virtues and use them in ways they haven&rsquo;t yet considered. Accessible and proven, <i>Authentic Happiness</i> is the most powerful work of popular psychology in years.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>From <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Christopher Rice comes a novel about an Iraq war vet seeking redemption and revenge when a fellow Marine is brutally murdered.</b><BR><BR>John Houck became a Marine to become a hero. But his life changed when he failed to notice an explosive device that ended up maiming his captain, a respected military man who nearly sacrificed himself to save John&rsquo;s life. Home from Iraq, John pays a visit to his former captain, only to discover the captain has been gruesomely murdered. John pursues a strange man he sees running from the scene, but he discovers that Alex Martin is not the murderer. Alex is, in fact, the former captain&rsquo;s secret male lover and the killer&rsquo;s intended next victim.<BR> <BR>A gripping story of honor and integrity, of turning failure into victory, <i>Blind Fall</i> is the story of two men, one a Marine, one gay, who must unite to avenge the death of the man they both loved&#8212;one as a brother-in-arms, one as a lover&#8212;and to survive.]]></d104>

The suggested questions are intended to help your reading group find new and interesting angles and topics for your discussion. We hope that these ideas will enrich your conversation and increase your enjoyment of the book.&nbsp;</i><BR><BR><b>&nbsp;</b><BR><BR><b><u>For Discussion</u></b><BR><BR>1. When John visits Mike Bowers in the air force hospital, why does Mike offer to get John a gift in Germany? Why won&#8217;t Mike give John the opportunity to say what he went there with the intention of saying?<BR><BR>2. Mike is depicted through John and Alex&#8217;s stories and impressions of him. What about Mike&#8217;s character and personality do you learn from their portrayals? What is the significance of each separate instance when Mike gives John and Alex the thumbs up?<BR><BR>3. Why does John take it upon himself to look after Li&#8217;l D? Do you think that the author made a choice not to reintroduce Li&#8217;l D after his brief appearance toward the beginning of the book?<BR><BR>4. Discuss the novel&#8217;s narrative style and plotting. When did you begin to suspect who the real murderer was? When did you begin to understand all of the circumstances that surrounded the murder?<BR><BR>5. When Duncan and Alex are in John&#8217;s trailer, why does Alex attack John when they begin to suspect the truth as opposed to report their suspicions to the authorities?<BR><BR>6. Alex&#8217;s friend Philip suggests that Alex was forced to make huge sacrifices for Mike. Is there any truth in this accusation? In spite of the risks involved in their relationship, what did Alex and Mike provide for each other?<BR><BR>7. John is propelled by his quest for forgiveness and a deep sense of integrity. In what ways does this part of his personality impede both his relationships and his ultimate goals?<BR><BR>8. What roles do John&#8217;s sister Patsy and Alex each play in helping John to understand the incident between his brother Dean and Danny Oster? In the end, does John forgive Danny Oster? Does he forgive himself for what happened to Dean?<BR><BR>9. How did you react when you discovered the true circumstances surrounding Alex&#8217;s estrangement from his parents? Did it increase or decrease your compassion for his character? What does Alex&#8217;s mother&#8217;s vicious attack illuminate about her nature and the environment Alex grew up in? <BR><BR>10. Discuss Alex and John&#8217;s relationship in terms of how it develops throughout the novel. Does one character learn more or make a bigger transformation than the other? Though horribly tragic, how does Mike&#8217;s death help each of them become stronger, more tolerant, and more at peace with themselves?<BR><BR>11. What does the epigraph imply toward the novel&#8217;s message?<BR><BR>12. Discuss the novel&#8217;s title. What is its significance?<BR><BR>13.

Read one of the nonfiction books about Marine life that Rice mentions in his acknowledgments as a companion text.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR><b><u>A Conversation with Christopher Rice</u><BR><BR>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; The prologue is a brutal depiction of the consequences of war. What sources did you rely upon in order to accurately convey the battle scene and the Air Force hospital?</b><BR><BR>A:&nbsp; I devoured many incredibly good nonfiction books about the Marine Corps experience in Iraq which are listed on the acknowledgments page. I also sat down with real Marines and talked with them about their experiences. But when it came to depicting the scenes inside of the U.S. Air Force Theatre Hospital at Balad, I was greatly assisted by a wonderful series of investigative pieces that appeared in the Los Angeles Times by staff writer David Zucchino. I never traveled to Iraq so the prologue was a big challenge for me. In fact, I refused to write a prologue set in Iraq until the very end of the revision process, when my editor simply demanded one. I knew he was right so I finally caved in.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR><b>Q:&nbsp; Your previous novel, <i>Light Before Day</i>, also features a Marine character.&nbsp; What has inspired you to focus on the Marines? What are some other literary depictions of the life of a Marine that you would recommend to an interested reader?</b><BR><BR>A:&nbsp; Marines have been a part of my life since I moved to California eight years ago. I&#8217;ve counted them among my friends and I&#8217;ve been romantically involved with several of them. I was immediately fascinated by the double-life gay Marines are forced to lead if they want to serve their country and I thought it would make for the perfect premise for a noir-fueled tale.&nbsp; Oddly enough, when it comes to other literary depictions of Marine life, I didn&#8217;t read any of them as prep for writing this novel. I stuck entirely to nonfiction because for some reason it felt like there was less of a risk that I would steal someone else&#8217;s literary voice. I was very conscious of the fact that I was an outsider trying to write about this world from an insider&#8217;s point of view so I was very picky about what I would put into my brain while I was writing the novel.&nbsp;<BR><BR>But the novel that was referenced in most of the books I read was <i>Fields of Fire</i> by James Webb. He&#8217;s a senator now and is largely credited with helping to reform the Marine Corps into the more disciplined environment that it is today. Rich Merrit is another writer readers might be interested in. His memoir and his novel both draw on his experiences as a gay Marine at the dawn of the Don&#8217;t Ask, Don&#8217;t Tell policy on gays in the military.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR><b>Q:&nbsp; Did you ever consider revealing what Alex may have done with his inheritance? Why or why not?</b><BR><BR>A:&nbsp; I felt very strongly that this was John&#8217;s novel. That meant, the second&#8212;not the minute, but the second&#8212;John accomplished his mission and encountered the revelation that was waiting for him at the end of it, the book had to end. I have never been more proud of anything I&#8217;ve written than I am of the final scene of Blind Fall. I had the ending in my head long before I finished the book and I was steadily working my way toward it, using it as a carrot to keep myself motivated. By the time I reached the end, I realized there was another major scene I hadn&#8217;t allowed for, and that was Alex&#8217;s reaction to learning his estranged mother has been killed. Here again, I applied the same rule. The scene wouldn&#8217;t have ultimately been about John so I let it go. You have to make these calls when you&#8217;re writing a novel, and sometimes they&#8217;re not easy. But they allow the reader to focus on the story you&#8217;re actually telling.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR><b>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; Describe your writing process. Given that you are a thriller-writer, do you conceive of the crime first and then fill in the story with character development?</b><BR><BR>A:&nbsp; Usually, I start with a visual that suggests a crime and a character. With The Snow Garden, I had this image of a young woman returning to the fraternity house she lived in on a snowy college campus and opening the front door to find everyone inside of it dead and naked and sprawled out on the living room floor. With Light Before Day, it was a missing-persons flyer I kept seeing in my head, taped to a light post in West Hollywood, with the faces of three handsome young gay men on it. But Blind Fall, as well as the novel I&#8217;m working on now, were different. The character came to me first, without any visual elements attached to him.<BR><BR>John Houck came to me almost fully formed. And that seems to be how it works now. The character shows up first, asking to be figured out, and the crime is only important in as much as it develops that character. But I still inspire myself with visuals. I have a wall of corkboard in my office which I cover with photos and maps of settings I&#8217;m going to use. As for outlining, I struggle with it. I&#8217;ve never found that I can write a &#8220;down-to-the-last detail&#8221; outline. I usually amass just enough scene ideas to get me started.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR><b>Q:&nbsp; At twenty-nine, you were already the author of three <i>New York Times</i> bestselling novels. When did you start writing? What role did your parents, vampire novelist Anne Rice and poet Stan Rice, play in your literary development?</b><BR><BR>A:&nbsp; They were always very encouraging of all my creative endeavors. But if I hadn&#8217;t written <i>A Density of Souls</i> when I did, I might have been in serious trouble. I had dropped out of two colleges in a row, been readmitted to one of them after two years, and then moved out to L.A. on a whim instead of going back to school. So it was time for me to do something serious or we were going to have a big family discussion and it wasn&#8217;t going to be pretty. So I wrote <i>A Density of Souls</i> largely to give myself an outlet while my mother was recovering from a diabetic coma, but largely because I needed to finish something. My father&#8217;s reaction to the novel is what kept me from putting it in a drawer once it was done. He said, &#8220;This is going to change your life.&#8221;<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR><b>Q:&nbsp; In addition to being a novelist, you are also a columnist for <i>The Advocate</i>. Is it difficult to transition between journalism and writing fiction? How does one process inform the other?</b><BR><BR>A:&nbsp; <i>The Advocate</i> columns are always a challenge for me but I find them incredibly rewarding. There&#8217;s no hiding. It has to be just you, right out in front, in seven hundred words. Ninety percent of the work I do with each column is marshaling the courage to state my honest opinion without fear of retaliation. I spent most of my early young life as a people-pleaser; my columns have been a great exercise in gradually letting that go and being who I am. But I also think learning how to state your point in just seven hundred words has helped me to focus my fiction as well. But I&#8217;ve always found it harder to write something that is shorter. Short stories literally send me for a tailspin. They&#8217;re so difficult.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR><b>Q:&nbsp; You are a native of California but a Southerner by blood. Although the majority of the novel is set in southern California, your protagonist, John Houck, is originally from Baton Rouge. Do you prefer one setting over the other when writing? Are there other places that you may wish to explore in future books?</b><BR><BR>A:&nbsp; My next novel <i>The Moonlit Earth</i> will use several settings throughout Southeast Asia and Hong Kong. But the main character is from California. In fact, the novel opens in Cathedral Beach, Alex Martin&#8217;s affluent hometown. But in general, I&#8217;m leery of questions like this because I find whenever I make a long-term prediction about what I&#8217;m going to write, I usually shatter it within a few months of making it. That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t like to say very much about books I&#8217;m still working on, because there&#8217;s always a good chance the brief synopsis I provide won&#8217;t apply in a few months&#8217; time. But I can say with confidence that California is my home now and I don&#8217;t see my work wandering too far away from it.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR><b>Q:&nbsp; In your acknowledgments, you thank several Marines who must remain anonymous because they are gay. How was conducting the research for and writing this book difficult? What made it rewarding?</b><BR><BR>A:&nbsp; This was the most &#8220;real world&#8221; research I&#8217;ve ever done, meaning I actually sat down and talked with people who were leading the lives I wanted to depict. I didn&#8217;t just pull it out of a book. But John was the first protagonist I tackled whose everyday life felt worlds away from my own, so there really wasn&#8217;t another way to do it. What&#8217;s rewarding about that kind of research is that there are beautiful accidents that happen. Your interview subjects say things they don&#8217;t think are important but which end up inspiring entire scenes. But there are rules. I&#8217;m not comfortable using things they tell me which are deeply personal, unless I get their explicit permission. I&#8217;m not out to steal someone&#8217;s story. I&#8217;m trying to add a layer of authenticity to the story I&#8217;m developing on my own. With this novel, there were moments of having my eyes opened to the realities of war that were irreversible. When one of my Marine contacts described his first kill to me, I was humbled into absolute silence.<BR><BR><b>Q:&nbsp; &nbsp;What educational programs or legislation might you hope to see enacted in order to increase tolerance within the military for homosexuality? What do you think is the best solution to put an end to the intolerance?</b><BR><BR>A:&nbsp; Gays and lesbians must be allowed to serve openly in the military. Period. Nothing short of that will do. Don&#8217;t Ask, Don&#8217;t Tell is a disgraceful policy that has ruined lives and undermined unit cohesion by creating layers of secrecy and denial within the Marine Corps. Tolerance for homosexuality within the military is as generational as it is in the outside world, meaning the younger you are, the more likely you are to be accepting of gay people. When it comes to Marines, I&#8217;m confident that any young gay man who can survive Hell Week will be able to live through the painful period of adjustment that might follow an all-out repeal on the ban.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR><b>Q:&nbsp; Are you currently working on another novel? If so, can you share some details about the project?</b><BR><BR>A:&nbsp; My next novel will be called <i>The Moonlit Earth</i> and as I mentioned before, it&#8217;s set largely in the town of Cathedral Beach. It&#8217;s about a young woman whose privileged life is shaken to its foundations when she&#8217;s presented with evidence that her younger brother may have been involved in a terrorist plot in Southeast Asia. And I&#8217;m going as fast I can without sacrificing quality! Many of my readers have told me they&#8217;re tired of waiting so long, so I&#8217;m hoping to have this one in front of them very soon.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[The epic four-volume cycle that began with Larry McMurty's Pulitzer Prize-winning masterpiece, <i>Lonesome Dove</i>, is completed with this brilliant and haunting novel - a capstone in a mighty tradition of storytelling. <BR> <BR> Texas Rangers August McCrae and Woodrow F. Call, now in their middle years, are just beginning to deal with the enigmas of the adult heart - Gus with his great love, Clara Forsythe; and Call with Maggie Tilton, the young whore who loves him. Two proud but very different men, they enlist with a Ranger troop in pursuit of Buffalo Hump, the great Comanche war chief; Kicking Wolf, the celebrated Comanche horse thief; and a deadly Mexican bandit king with a penchant for torture. <BR> <BR> <i>Comanche Moon</i> joins the twenty-year time line between Dead Man's Walk and Lonesome Dove, following beloved heroes Gus and Call and their comrades-in-arms - Deets, Jake Spoon, and Pea Eye Parker - in their bitter struggle to protect an advancing Western frontier against the defiant Comanches, courageously determined to defend their territory and their way of life. <BR> <BR> At once vividly imagined and unflinchingly realistic, <i>Comanche Moon</i> is a sweeping, heroic adventure full of tragedy, cruelty, courage, honor and betrayal - and the culmination of Larry McMurty's peerless vision of the American West.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[In <I>Zeke and Ned,</I> Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana have created an American masterpiece: funny, exuberant, compelling, violent, and tragic. <BR> Set in the Cherokee Nation not Jong after the Civil War, <I>Zeke and Ned</I> is the story of Ezekiel Proctor and Ned Christie, the last Cherokee warriors, living men whose story is not merely legend, but history -- their fates a consequence of the brutal policies which produced the Trail of Tears. As a child, Zeke Proctor walked the Trail of Tears from Georgia to the Indian Territory west of Arkansas, acquiring through that bitter struggle a fierce loyalty to the Cherokee way. Though a family man and a respected member of the Cherokee Senate, Zeke the man is an adventurous charmer, with a family roving eye. <BR> Ned Christie is tall and charismatic, with waist-length hair and a high-cheekboned handsomeness, that appeals to women all over the Going Snake District. But Ned's heart is set on one woman: Jewel Sixkiller Proctor, Zeke's beautiful young daughter. And Ned's long and determined resistance to the relentless pressure of white law unwittingly makes him a hero to the Cherokee people. <BR> <I>Zeke and Ned</I> is a powerful, affecting work dramatizing the long Cherokee struggle against white authority. It is, ultimately, a moving tale about love, honour, loyalty, heroism, and the human condition.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[In <I>Streets of Laredo,</I> McMurtry brought the story ahead, giving us Call in his old age. Now, in <I>Dead Man's Walk,</I> he takes us back to the days when Gus and Call were young Texas Rangers, first experiencing the wild frontier that will form their characters. We also meet Clara Forsythe, the unforgettable young woman whose effect on Gus McCrae is immediate and unshakable. Danger, sacrifice, comradeship, and love give them the strength and courage to survive against the almost insurmountable odds of the frontier. <BR> In <I>Dead Man's Walk,</I> Gus and Call are not yet twenty, young men coming of age in the days when Texas was still an independent republic. Enlisting as Texas Rangers under a land pirate who wants to seize Santa Fe from the Mexicans, Gus and Call experience their first great adventure in the barren great plains landscape, in which arbitrary violence is the rule -- whether from nature, or from the Indians whose territory they must cross in order to reach New Mexico. <BR> From the Indians defending their land with unrelenting savagery, to the Texans attempting to seize and "civilize" it, and the Mexicans threatened by both, the reckless men of the untamed frontier make this at once a riveting adventure story and a powerful work of literature.]]></d104>

Beautiful in their simplicity, startling in their originality, and unsurpassed in their craftsmanship, the stories in this volume highlight one of America's master storytellers at the top of his form.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>Classic short stories from the master of American fiction exploring relationships, war, and sportsmanship.</b><BR><BR>First published in 1927, <i>Men Without Women</i> represents some of Hemingway's most important and compelling early writing. In these fourteen stories, Hemingway begins to examine the themes that would occupy his later works: the casualties of war, the often-uneasy relationship between men and women, sport and sportsmanship. In "Banal Story," Hemingway offers a lasting tribute to the famed matador Maera. "In Another Country" tells of an Italian major recovering from war wounds as he mourns the untimely death of his wife. "The Killers" is the hard-edged story about two Chicago gunmen and their potential victim. Nick Adams makes an appearance in "Ten Indians," in which he is presumably betrayed by his Indian girlfriend, Prudence. And "Hills Like White Elephants" is a young couple's subtle, heart-wrenching discussion of abortion. Pared down, gritty, and subtly expressive, these stories show the young Hemingway emerging as America's finest short story writer.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>A strikingly original collection of short stories and accompanying vignettes that marked Ernest Hemingway&rsquo;s American debut.</b><BR><BR>When <i>In Our Time</i> was first published in 1925, it was widely praised for its simple and precise use of language to convey a wide range of complex emotions, and earned Hemingway a place among the most promising American writers of that period. <i>In Our Time</i> contains several early Hemingway classics, including the famous Nick Adams stories &ldquo;Indian Camp&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Three Day Blow,&rdquo; and introduces readers to the hallmarks of the Hemingway style: a lean, tough prose, enlivened by an ear for the colloquial and an eye for the realistic. His writing suggests, through the simplest of statements, a sense of moral value and a clarity of vision.<BR> <BR>Now recognized as one of the most important short story collections of twentieth-century literature, <i>In Our Time</i> provides key insights into Hemingway&rsquo;s later works.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[Ernest Hemingway did more to influence the style of English prose than any other writer of his time. He has been called &ldquo;the most important author since Shakespeare,&rdquo; by John O&rsquo;Hara in <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>. The publication of <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> and <i>A Farewell to Arms</i> immediately established him as one of the greatest literary lights of the 20th century. His classic novella <i>The Old Man and the Sea </i>won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. Hemingway was also awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. His life and accomplishments are explored in-depth in the PBS documentary film from Ken Burns and Lynn Novick, <i>Hemingway</i>. He died in 1961.<BR> <BR> Stacy Keach a star of stage, film, and television, won a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy Nomination for his acclaimed portrayal of <i>Hemingway</i> in the definitive television epic. His films include <i>American History X, Escape from LA, Keep Your Distance,</i> and <i>Birds of Passage.</i> Other television features include <i>Prison Break,</i> and <i>Titus.</i> Mr. Keach read all three volumes of <i>The Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway</i> for Simon & Schuster Audio.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>Ernest Hemingway&rsquo;s classic memoir of Paris in the 1920s, now available in a restored edition, includes the original manuscript along with insightful recollections and unfinished sketches.</b><BR><BR>Published posthumously in 1964, <i>A Moveable Feast</i> remains one of Ernest Hemingway&rsquo;s most enduring works. Since Hemingway&rsquo;s personal papers were released in 1979, scholars have examined the changes made to the text before publication. Now, this special restored edition presents the original manuscript as the author prepared it to be published.<BR> <BR>Featuring a personal foreword by Patrick Hemingway, Ernest&rsquo;s sole surviving son, and an introduction by grandson of the author, Se&#225;n Hemingway, editor of this edition, the book also includes a number of unfinished, never-before-published Paris sketches revealing experiences that Hemingway had with his son, Jack, and his first wife Hadley. Also included are irreverent portraits of literary luminaries, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ford Maddox Ford, and insightful recollections of Hemingway&rsquo;s own early experiments with his craft.<BR> <BR>Widely celebrated and debated by critics and readers everywhere, the restored edition of <i>A Moveable Feast </i>brilliantly evokes the exuberant mood of Paris after World War I and the unbridled creativity and unquenchable enthusiasm that Hemingway himself epitomized.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<i>This reading group guide for </i><b>Scarlet Nights</b><i>&nbsp;includes an introduction, discussion questions, ideas for enhancing your book club, and a Q&amp;A with author <b>Jude Deveraux</b>. The suggested questions are intended to help your reading group find new and interesting angles and topics for your discussion. We hope that these ideas will enrich your conversation and increase your enjoyment of the book. </i><BR><BR><b></b>&nbsp;<BR><BR><b><u>Introduction</u></b><BR><BR>Sara Shaw is beautiful, good-hearted, a devoted churchgoer, and the best pie maker around. The catch: she&#8217;s engaged to a man everyone despises, a man who happens to lead a secret life of fraud and thievery and who is wanted by the FBI. When Mike Newland, an undercover cop assigned to catch Sara&#8217;s fianc&#233; Greg and his convict mother, arrives in Sara&#8217;s small town of Edilean, Virginia, things begin to heat up. Mike must work to gain Sara&#8217;s trust to help him catch the infamous criminals&#8212;and in the process, he falls head over heels for Sara. Together Mike and Sara discover the secret of the town&#8212;and Mike&#8217;s family&#8212;that has been hidden for nearly seventy years. In the end, Mike finally learns what it means to have a family and Sara realizes what it means to be loved. <BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR><b><u>Questions and Topics for Discussion</u></b><BR><BR>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Sometimes she felt torn between the man she loved and the town she adored&#8221; (22). &nbsp;Sara faces this dilemma early in the story as she is forced to choose between her quiet country life and family and the man with whom she has fallen in love and agreed to marry. Was there a singular event you see as the moment of Sara&#8217;s realization that the world is not an easy place&#8212;even in the seemingly perfect town of Edilean, Virginia? Why do you think she falls in love with Greg Anders? Why do you think it took an outsider&#8212;Mike&#8212;to open Sara&#8217;s eyes to the truth about Greg? <BR><BR>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discuss the significance of Merlin&#8217;s Farm. What does it represent for Sara? Arguably, the farm was both an escape and an entrapment&#8212;without the farm, Greg would not have wanted Sara. But the farm is also the setting where Sara and Mike first fall in love. Do you see the farm as more of an escape or an entrapment for Sara? How so? <BR><BR>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does the title <i>Scarlet Nights </i>symbolize?&nbsp;<BR><BR>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you think Mike keeps his personal life a secret from his coworkers and friends? Why does he find it so difficult to tell Sara the truth? Do you think he is ashamed of his past? <BR><BR>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do Ramsey and Tess factor into the story? Do you view them as minor characters or as necessary to the integrity of the story? How much or how little do you think Ramsey and Tess aided in Sara&#8217;s discovery of love, happiness, and survival? <BR><BR>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How would you characterize Mr. Lang? What are his intentions? Consider his character from the points of view of Sara, Ellie, Mike, and the collective town. Who do you think knows the &#8220;real&#8221; Mr. Lang? How can you tell? <BR><BR>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The novel opens in Fort Lauderdale, but most of the story takes place in Edilean. Discuss how the different settings help transform Mike and Sara. Would it have been possible for Mike to change if he hadn&#8217;t been to Edilean? Would Mike and Sara&#8217;s relationship have been different if she hadn&#8217;t gone to Fort Lauderdale against his wishes? <BR><BR>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The struggle for intimacy and openness is a central theme in the novel. On page 3, Mike thinks, &#8220;Experience had taught him to reveal as little about himself as possible.&#8221; Think of other examples of the struggle for intimacy in the novel. Consider Sara, Mike, Tess, Mr. Lang, and Sara&#8217;s sisters in your response. How do each of these characters struggle with opening up to their family and friends? <BR><BR>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did you make of Mike&#8217;s initial good impression on the town of Edilean? Do you think initially his kindness was part of his act? If so, when did it become sincere? Why was everyone so willing to believe him? Why wasn&#8217;t Sara? <BR><BR>10.&nbsp; Discuss Sara and Ariel&#8217;s rivalry. What is the root of their dislike for one another? Are the two more similar or more different? Do you think they will ever be friends? <BR><BR>11.&nbsp; Revisit Mike and Sara&#8217;s picnic at Merlin&#8217;s Farm, beginning on page 109. Do you think Mike was showing his true feelings for Sara? Was this the moment they fell in love? How can you tell? <BR><BR>12.&nbsp; In <i>Scarlet Nights, </i>appearances are often very deceiving. Greg is really Stefan, Mrs. Myers is really Mitzi, and Mike is really in love with Sara. Think of other examples where things are not what they seem in the story. How does the author exploit this conceit? For what purpose do you think the author made use of this theme?<BR><BR>13.&nbsp; What was your reaction to the ending of the story? Would you call Sara the heroine? Do you think Mike and Sara will live happily ever after? <BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR><b><u>Enhance Your Book Club</u></b><BR><BR>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edilean, Virginia, is a fictional town, but it represents an idea of small-town life that is part of our collective conscience. If you don&#8217;t already live in a small town, take a daytrip with your book club to one nearby. Visit restaurants, shops, and churches. Talk to the locals and sample the food for which the town is most proud. Over lunch, discuss with your book club the similarities and differences between this town and Edilean. Can you imagine high-profile criminals slipping unnoticed into town life? Why or why not? <BR><BR>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jude Deveraux is a popular bestselling author. If you haven&#8217;t done so already, have your book club read the previous two books in the Edilean family series, which began with <i>Lavender Morning</i> and continued with <i>Days of Gold.</i> Or, if your book club has already read these novels, discuss the characters that overlap. Do they change from one book to the next? Does Edilean change? Which book is the group&#8217;s favorite?&nbsp;<BR><b>&nbsp;</b><BR>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The characters in <i>Scarlet Nights</i> are deeply connected to their Scottish heritage. Recreate the festival with your book club. Host a party and have each member wear a medieval gown or kilt like the characters in the book. Serve lavender cookies, have a tarot card reader, and serve Scottish beverages. Have one member research the history of Scotland and present the group with a history lesson. Why do you think the town felt so closely connected to Scotland? <BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR><u><b>A Conversation with Jude Deveraux</b><BR></u><BR><b>You&#8217;ve written several other historical romance novels. Did any of your previous books inspire this story? Are there more books to come in the Edilean family series? </b><BR><BR>In the past, I wrote a series about two families, but I found that limiting, so I decided to create a town. I came up with seven founding families, showed their personalities and interests in <i>Days of Gold,</i> then carried them forward. Yes, I plan to write lots more books set in Edilean. I truly and deeply love my characters.<BR><BR>I want to write about other characters in the town besides those from the founding families. I want to see how they feel about living in a town that&#8217;s run by families that have lived there for centuries.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR><b>Who is your favorite character in the story and why? Do you think this is Mike&#8217;s story more so than any other character&#8217;s? Why or why not? </b><BR><BR>I think Mike&#8217;s life changed the most. He was a very lonely man, but he didn&#8217;t know it. His sister, Tess, did and she fought to give him a life, but Mike didn&#8217;t know what he was missing.<BR><BR>But I also think Sara&#8217;s life changed. She was devastated by the loss of Brian, the man she loved. She had her entire life planned out, knew where she was going and with whom, then zap! it was all taken from her in an instant. It took away her sense of self. I think maybe she felt that all she deserved was a man like Greg.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR><b>How did you come to be a writer? What is your background, and who are your influences? </b><BR><BR>I write because I have stories running around in my head. I never dreamed of being a &#8220;writer&#8221; per se. I just wanted to put the stories in my mind onto paper. I haven&#8217;t changed. I still have characters in my thoughts, and I want to find out what happened to them. I want to hear them talk and see what they do if they are in a certain situation.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR><b>Describe the journey you took while writing this book. How many hours of research did you have to do in order to capture the spirit of the Southern town? Is Edilean based on your hometown? Was there any character that you spent more time researching than the others?</b><BR><BR>Edilean isn&#8217;t based on any particular small U.S. town but all of them. As for the research, I spent many, many hours on it. My good friend Detective Charlie Stack helped me with all of it. He directed me to books and websites and he answered all my questions, whether I asked about martial arts or economic crimes.<BR><BR>I spent more of the time learning about the types of fraud that people like my fictional Mitzi committed than I did anything else. It was fascinating to me how women like her work. <BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR><b>You have been praised by <i>Romantic Times </i>magazine as an author who &#8220;has always enchanted readers&#8221; and who &#8220;instinctively knows what every woman is searching for&#8212;her own knight in shining armor.&#8221; Was your goal to have Sara find her &#8220;knight in shining armor&#8221;? Do you think this is a correct assessment of what your books aim to do? </b><BR><BR>I like for my people to find True Love&#8212;and that&#8217;s not always easy. I have started writing several books in which the hero and heroine disliked each other so much that I discarded the book. It&#8217;s okay if they think they hate one another but feel physical attraction, but if there&#8217;s nothing between them, then I can&#8217;t work with it.<BR><BR>As for Sara, she deeply and truly needed someone to rescue her. I don&#8217;t think she realized&#8212;but the town did&#8212;that she was heading down into a deep depression, one that she probably wouldn&#8217;t have recovered from. Even if Greg Anders weren&#8217;t a criminal, the truth was that he didn&#8217;t <i>need</i><u> </u>Sara. Mike did. Sara gave him a home and a future. They were perfect together. <BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR><b>Why did you decide to tell the story from both Mike&#8217;s and Sara&#8217;s points of view? What effect do you think this has on the story overall? </b><BR><BR>Sometimes I need for a character not to know what&#8217;s going on in the story, so I write in first person. In <i>Scarlet Nights</i> there was so much going on that I had to keep the reader informed of every change and every secret. When I was first plotting the book, I thought of telling the story just from Sara&#8217;s point of view. What Mike was doing and why would be kept a secret, but when I tried that, he came off as a jerk. He was sneaking into the apartment, then staying there even when Sara told him to leave. It didn&#8217;t work! I changed it all and told the reader everything upfront. &nbsp;Sara was the one who didn&#8217;t know what was going on, not the reader.<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR><b>Did any real-life criminals inspire the characters of Greg Anders and his mother? </b><BR><BR>Yes, they did. In fact, everything I wrote about Mitzi and Greg is the truth, based on real cases. <BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR><b>You have a remarkable talent for capturing the description of Southern life, especially the food and the landscape. Was it difficult to bring the South to life? Do you write more from experience or imagination? </b><BR><BR>I just write about Edilean as I see the town and the people. Since I am Southern, I describe what I know.<BR><BR>I have a passion for old houses, so it&#8217;s been fun to find houses that fit my people, then have them walk around inside. If I use an old house as the model, I like to imagine how the residents over the years would have remodeled it. I always have a thick stack of photos of the house, the facade, the floor plan, and the setting. Merlin&#8217;s Farm has been the most interesting because there&#8217;s so much to it. I have many pages of photos of that place, as it&#8217;s based on an actual plantation.&nbsp; <BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR><b>Who is your favorite author? Who are you reading now? What is next for you? </b><BR><BR>I don&#8217;t really have a favorite author. The truth is that I read very little fiction. I read a lot of nonfiction for my research. I have several TV shows that I watch, as I think it&#8217;s good for me to keep up with current slang and what&#8217;s going on in the world. I also watch a lot of movies and I have favorite DVDs that I play often.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[Discussion Questions for:</br> </br> <b>Dork Diaries</b></br> By Rachel Ren&#233;e Russell</br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 1: Tales from a Not-So-Fabulous Life</b></i></br> </br> 1. Nikki is starting at a new private school. How does she learn about the culture of the school and figure out who is trustworthy? Have you ever had to start over at a new school? If yes, how did it feel? If no, how do you think you would act the first few days? </br> </br> 2. When Nikki&#8217;s mom tells her she&#8217;s getting a back-to-school present that will help her &#8220;communicate her thoughts and feelings,&#8221; she is so excited because she thinks it will be a new cell phone. Instead, Nikki&#8217;s mom gives her a diary. Nikki is incredibly disappointed, not just because she didn&#8217;t get a cell phone, but also because she thinks a paper diary is outdated. Despite her initial resistance, Nikki ends up writing a lot in her diary. Do you think paper diaries are outdated? Would you rather share your thoughts and commentary about school life privately in a diary, or more publicly using an online forum such as a blog or social networking site like Facebook? </br> </br> 3. Nikki feels that her bedroom should be her own private space. At school, she, Chloe, and Zoey use the janitor&#8217;s closet for their meetings. Do you have your own bedroom or another special space that feels like it is all your own? If so, who makes up the rules for this special place? If you could have complete dominion over your space, what would be your top three rules? </br> </br> 4. At first, Nikki thinks Chloe and Zoey are kind of annoying, but she gets past her first impression of the pair when they all bond over their shared dislike of MacKenzie. As the story progresses and they become closer friends, we see more of their shared interests and also their differences. What do you think makes a good friend? How do the girls demonstrate these characteristics? </br> </br> 5. Sometimes family or close friends develop their own special ways of communicating through shared gestures and vocabulary, secret handshakes, and other signals. For Nikki, Chloe, and Zoey, the language of friendship already includes jazz hands, the stinkeye, and a lot of acronyms like CCPS (Cute, Cool, and Popular), 4Fs (Friends, Fun, Fashion, and Flirting), and GGG-ing (Giggling, Gossiping, and Glossing). Some of them come from magazines or popular culture, and some seem to be the girls&#8217; own inventions. What are some of your favorite words, phrases, gestures, and inside jokes you share with your family or friends? </br> </br> 6. Do you think the &#8220;thank you for the oatmeal&#8221; note Nikki&#8217;s mom leaves is sincere, or is she trying to let Nikki know that she is on to her deception but forgives her? Either way, Nikki is very relieved that she&#8217;s not in trouble. Have you had a close call where you thought you were busted but ended up being just fine? What happened? </br> </br> 7. Several times when Nikki is writing about a conversation from earlier in the day, she includes her own very honest and blunt reply, then explains, &#8220;But I just say it inside my head, so no one really hears it except me.&#8221; When is it good to self-censor? When would it be better to speak up? How can we learn to tell the difference? </br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 2: Tales from a Not-So-Popular Party Girl</b></i></br> </br> 1. Nikki&#8217;s arch nemesis MacKenzie continues torturing her in this second Dork Diaries volume by calling her names, making fun of her clothes, and dissing her friends and artistic talent. Do you have an arch nemesis? What makes this person your ultimate rival? What would you do if you had lockers next to each other? </br> </br> 2. Nikki finds out that she won $500 in the Avant-garde Art Contest. She had originally planned to use the money to buy a cell phone, but decided instead to save the money for art camp next summer. If you won $500, what would you do with it? </br> </br> 3. Nikki admits that her major crush on Brandon has caused RCS (Roller Coaster Syndrome). What does this mean? Have you ever had this feeling when you are around someone you have a crush on? Does it impact your ability to talk to him or her? </br> </br> 4. Throughout the book, Nikki continually talks about how she is so unpopular, ranking herself lower on the WCD CCP Popularity Index Chart than the school janitor, school mascot, and head lunch lady. In fact, she calls her own diary the &#8220;Dork Diary,&#8221; and often refers to herself as a dork throughout the book. However, Nikki has several best friends and a popular boy has a crush on her. How do you define popularity? Who determines who is popular at your school? Do you think how you view yourself impacts how others view you? </br> </br> 5. Nikki&#8217;s mom always wanted to be a ballerina, so she signed up both her daughters for lessons, even though neither of them wanted to attend ballet classes. Have your parents ever forced you to do something you didn&#8217;t want to do? How did you respond? </br> </br> 6. During MacKenzie&#8217;s party, Jessica &#8220;accidentally&#8221; bumps Nikki&#8217;s plate of fruit and chocolate, causing the entire plate of food to spill all over Nikki&#8217;s new party dress in front of everyone. Out of embarrassment, Nikki leaves the party and doesn&#8217;t even take the opportunity to talk to her crush Brandon, as she is waiting around outside for her dad to pick her up. Have you ever been embarrassed by someone else in front of your peers? How did you handle it? If you could go back and respond differently, would you? What would you do differently? </br> </br> 7. In response to her little sister&#8217;s fairy phobia and constant pleas for a bathroom monitor in the middle of the night, Nikki comes up with a plan to banish the imaginary tooth fairy in Brianna&#8217;s room for good using a homemade repellent made with water, vinegar, tuna fish oil, sardine oil, and garlic. What&#8217;s the most unusual thing you have ever done to get your brother or sister to stop bothering you? </br> </br> 8. In Nikki&#8217;s own words, she was trying to &#8220;do it ALL&#8221; on Halloween, including paint faces at the ballet class Halloween party, attend the Halloween dance with Chloe and Zoey dressed as a bag of trash, and attend the Halloween dance as Brandon&#8217;s date, dressed as Shakespeare&#8217;s Juliet. Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you took on too much at one time? Were you successful? How would you do it differently if you had to do it over again? </br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 3: Tales from a Not-So-Talented Pop Star</b></i></br> </br> 1. Nikki discusses some of her fears in <i>Dork Diaries 3</i>. What was your biggest fear when you were little? What about now? </br> </br> 2. Why do you think Nikki&#8217;s parents decide to deliberately create Family Sharing Time? Does your family do anything like this? Nikki suggests her family do an extreme sport, like bungee jumping, together. What are some activities that you think would be good for Family Sharing Time? Why? </br> </br> 3. Nikki worries a lot about being seen doing things like dancing at Queasy Cheesy or getting dropped off in the roach van. Why can a situation be okay when nobody sees, but humiliating if observed? Why do we care? </br> </br> 4. Nikki doesn&#8217;t approach her mom about the video problem, her dad about the bug problem, or her friends about either problem. In the previous books, Nikki has also kept her problems to herself&#8212;even though her friends constantly prove loyal and helpful. Why doesn&#8217;t Nikki share her problems with others? Find three examples in the book that support your answer(s). </br> </br> 5. Language can be very powerful. Nikki and her friends decide to embrace the label &#8220;dork&#8221; when naming their band &#8220;Dorkalicious.&#8221; What happens when someone claims what might be considered a negative label, like &#8220;dork,&#8221; with pride? </br> </br> 6. Nikki writes that she is not jealous, because &#8220;How juvenile would THAT be?!&#8221; Her denial seems a bit too passionate to be believed, though. Do you ever get jealous even though you know you shouldn&#8217;t? How do you deal? </br> </br> 7. Nikki&#8217;s eccentric grandmother comes to visit for Thanksgiving. We learn that she belongs to an elderly Segway gang and takes road trips. If you have grandparents or older friends/family in your life, what do their lives look like? How are they similar to and different from Nikki&#8217;s grandma? What characteristic of theirs would you most like to possess when you get older? </br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 3 1/2: How to Dork Your Diary</b></i></br> </br> 1. Take the &#8220;Discover Your Diary Identity&#8221; quiz in the book. Do you think the result accurately describes your personality? How would YOU describe your personality and habits? Is Nikki's suggested diary-keeping format (based on your quiz results) the one you would be most likely to use for keeping a diary? Why or why not? Can you think of any other ways someone could keep track of their daily thoughts, emotions, and activities? </br> </br> 2. Why do you think Nikki writes, &#8220;Make sure you write in your diary every single day&#8221; even if you lose the original diary and have to write in a spare notebook? Why is keeping a diary important? </br> </br> 3. Several times in this book, Nikki initially discounts her friends&#8217; assistance and then is pleasantly surprised by the help and support they offer. For example, Nikki finally shares her problem with Chloe and Zoey and feels so relieved to have their help. When Nikki finally pays attention to the gift Brandon is trying to give her, it turns out to be really sweet and helpful. Have you ever discounted a friend's assistance at first and later accepted it? What happened? How did you feel? </br> </br> 4. Chloe goes Dumpster diving in search of Nikki&#8217;s diary. You&#8217;ve probably heard the saying that one man&#8217;s trash is another man&#8217;s treasure. If you cleaned out your old &#8220;junk,&#8221; unwanted gifts, and outgrown clothes to sell or donate, what kinds of things would you get rid of? What would you be delighted to spot at a garage sale or discarded at the side of the road? </br> </br> 5. Tongue-tied at being discovered in the boys&#8217; locker room, Zoey blurts out a quote from former President Franklin D. Roosevelt: &#8220;Men are not prisoners of fate, but only prisoners of their own minds.&#8221; In his first inaugural address, FDR also said, &#8220;the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.&#8221; What do you think these two quotes mean? </br> </br> 6. This whole book is about Nikki&#8217;s missing diary. What would you do if your diary went missing? Where would you look? Who would you blame? Even if you don&#8217;t keep a diary, imagine you discovered that everyone at school suddenly knew one of your biggest secrets. How do you think that could happen? How would you respond? </br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 4: Tales from a Not-So-Graceful Ice Princess</b></i></br> </br> 1. Have you ever felt completely overwhelmed by the task ahead of you? What would it take for you to step up to a challenge that previously seemed impossible? What techniques can make a large task more manageable? </br> </br> 2. Nikki decides she must beg MacKenzie to skate in her place, so they&#8217;ll be able to earn money for Fuzzy Friends. Have you ever had to put your group&#8217;s success above your personal desires or your ego? Why? What did that feel like? If you haven&#8217;t ever done so, in what circumstances do you think you would? Would it be easy or hard for you? </br> </br> 3. Nikki loves <i>Lady and the Tramp </i>and easily imagines herself in the classic romantic spaghetti dinner scene. What&#8217;s your favorite movie from childhood? How could you imagine yourself in a scene? Describe the setting and any friends you would cast beside you. Would you tweak anything from the original script, or would it play out pretty much the same in your life? </br> </br> 4. Even though MacKenzie cheats and pulls all kinds of mean tricks on Nikki, Nikki explains that because she wants to &#8220;be nice and show good sportsmanship,&#8221; she chooses not to taunt MacKenzie about the competition results. How do you define good sportsmanship? Provide three examples each of good and bad sportsmanship. </br> </br> 5. MacKenzie&#8217;s behavior to Nikki and her friends throughout the Dork Diaries series could be considered not just bad sportsmanship but actual bullying. Have you ever been bullied or acted like a bully? Why do you think people bully others? What is the best way to respond to a bully? </br> </br> 6. Nikki feels like she can&#8217;t ask Brandon what his hug means because doing so would betray her interest, so she feigns nonchalance and overanalyzes inside. Have you ever wanted to know something but been embarrassed or afraid even to admit you wanted to know? What, if anything, did you do to try to find out the answer to your question? </br> </br> 7. Nikki keeps Brandon&#8217;s secret, and she doesn&#8217;t even tell him that she knows. If you discovered a big secret about one of your friends, what would you do? </br> </br> 8. Nikki and her friends help in the library and read a lot. Throughout the Dork Diaries series, they refer to various trends in literature, film, and popular culture, like vampires, werewolves, and zombies. What is your favorite current trend? Least favorite? Why? </br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 5: Tales from a Not-So-Smart Miss Know-It-All</b></i></br> </br> 1. Nikki, Chloe, and Zoey each describe the characteristics for their ideal boyfriends. What would be the most important ingredients for your dream date? Why? </br> </br> 2. During their New Year&#8217;s Eve sleepover, the three girls play Truth or Dare. Which do you think takes more courage, sharing some information or doing some deed? Why? Why do you think this game remains popular over time? </br> </br> 3. The more Nikki considers all the ways MacKenzie has mistreated her, the more she thinks maybe Zoey is right that it&#8217;s time for payback. How can your friends affect your decision-making? Is there a line that, once crossed, would tempt you to seek revenge? Can you relate to Nikki&#8217;s description of ignoring the little voice of caution in your head? If so, how do you normally feel afterwards? </br> </br> 4. In the book, there is a list of positions on Nikki&#8217;s school newspaper available for new students. What role would you want on a school newspaper? Why? What role would you be least comfortable serving in, and why? </br> </br> 5. Nikki asks her best friends for advice. Their classmates write Miss Know-It-All for advice. Who can you ask for advice? Do you ask different people in different situations, or do you have one go-to person for most any problem? Does anybody come to you for advice? Why or why not? </br> </br> 6. Throughout the Dork Diaries series, Nikki has given many different kinds of gifts to her friends and family, including budget-saving handmade items, last-minute convenience presents, cherished items that are hard to share, and gifts that might also benefit her&#8212;like a dinner gift certificate for two. How do you decide what presents to give your friends and family? What&#8217;s the best gift you&#8217;ve ever given? The worst? </br> </br> </br> <b><u>A Note for Teachers</b></u></br> </br> This discussion guide is designed to help your students engage with the text through discussion in small or large groups.

Nikki is starting at a new private school. How does she learn about the culture of the school and figure out who is trustworthy? Have you ever had to start over at a new school? If yes, how did it feel? If no, how do you think you would act the first few days? </br> </br> 2. When Nikki&#8217;s mom tells her she&#8217;s getting a back-to-school present that will help her &#8220;communicate her thoughts and feelings,&#8221; she is so excited because she thinks it will be a new cell phone. Instead, Nikki&#8217;s mom gives her a diary. Nikki is incredibly disappointed, not just because she didn&#8217;t get a cell phone, but also because she thinks a paper diary is outdated. Despite her initial resistance, Nikki ends up writing a lot in her diary. Do you think paper diaries are outdated? Would you rather share your thoughts and commentary about school life privately in a diary, or more publicly using an online forum such as a blog or social networking site like Facebook? </br> </br> 3. Nikki feels that her bedroom should be her own private space. At school, she, Chloe, and Zoey use the janitor&#8217;s closet for their meetings. Do you have your own bedroom or another special space that feels like it is all your own? If so, who makes up the rules for this special place? If you could have complete dominion over your space, what would be your top three rules? </br> </br> 4. At first, Nikki thinks Chloe and Zoey are kind of annoying, but she gets past her first impression of the pair when they all bond over their shared dislike of MacKenzie. As the story progresses and they become closer friends, we see more of their shared interests and also their differences. What do you think makes a good friend? How do the girls demonstrate these characteristics? </br> </br> 5. Sometimes family or close friends develop their own special ways of communicating through shared gestures and vocabulary, secret handshakes, and other signals. For Nikki, Chloe, and Zoey, the language of friendship already includes jazz hands, the stinkeye, and a lot of acronyms like CCPS (Cute, Cool, and Popular), 4Fs (Friends, Fun, Fashion, and Flirting), and GGG-ing (Giggling, Gossiping, and Glossing). Some of them come from magazines or popular culture, and some seem to be the girls&#8217; own inventions. What are some of your favorite words, phrases, gestures, and inside jokes you share with your family or friends? </br> </br> 6. Do you think the &#8220;thank you for the oatmeal&#8221; note Nikki&#8217;s mom leaves is sincere, or is she trying to let Nikki know that she is on to her deception but forgives her? Either way, Nikki is very relieved that she&#8217;s not in trouble. Have you had a close call where you thought you were busted but ended up being just fine? What happened? </br> </br> 7. Several times when Nikki is writing about a conversation from earlier in the day, she includes her own very honest and blunt reply, then explains, &#8220;But I just say it inside my head, so no one really hears it except me.&#8221; When is it good to self-censor? When would it be better to speak up? How can we learn to tell the difference? </br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 2: Tales from a Not-So-Popular Party Girl</b></i></br> </br> 1. Nikki&#8217;s arch nemesis MacKenzie continues torturing her in this second Dork Diaries volume by calling her names, making fun of her clothes, and dissing her friends and artistic talent. Do you have an arch nemesis? What makes this person your ultimate rival? What would you do if you had lockers next to each other? </br> </br> 2. Nikki finds out that she won $500 in the Avant-garde Art Contest. She had originally planned to use the money to buy a cell phone, but decided instead to save the money for art camp next summer. If you won $500, what would you do with it? </br> </br> 3. Nikki admits that her major crush on Brandon has caused RCS (Roller Coaster Syndrome). What does this mean? Have you ever had this feeling when you are around someone you have a crush on? Does it impact your ability to talk to him or her? </br> </br> 4. Throughout the book, Nikki continually talks about how she is so unpopular, ranking herself lower on the WCD CCP Popularity Index Chart than the school janitor, school mascot, and head lunch lady. In fact, she calls her own diary the &#8220;Dork Diary,&#8221; and often refers to herself as a dork throughout the book. However, Nikki has several best friends and a popular boy has a crush on her. How do you define popularity? Who determines who is popular at your school? Do you think how you view yourself impacts how others view you? </br> </br> 5. Nikki&#8217;s mom always wanted to be a ballerina, so she signed up both her daughters for lessons, even though neither of them wanted to attend ballet classes. Have your parents ever forced you to do something you didn&#8217;t want to do? How did you respond? </br> </br> 6. During MacKenzie&#8217;s party, Jessica &#8220;accidentally&#8221; bumps Nikki&#8217;s plate of fruit and chocolate, causing the entire plate of food to spill all over Nikki&#8217;s new party dress in front of everyone. Out of embarrassment, Nikki leaves the party and doesn&#8217;t even take the opportunity to talk to her crush Brandon, as she is waiting around outside for her dad to pick her up. Have you ever been embarrassed by someone else in front of your peers? How did you handle it? If you could go back and respond differently, would you? What would you do differently? </br> </br> 7. In response to her little sister&#8217;s fairy phobia and constant pleas for a bathroom monitor in the middle of the night, Nikki comes up with a plan to banish the imaginary tooth fairy in Brianna&#8217;s room for good using a homemade repellent made with water, vinegar, tuna fish oil, sardine oil, and garlic. What&#8217;s the most unusual thing you have ever done to get your brother or sister to stop bothering you? </br> </br> 8. In Nikki&#8217;s own words, she was trying to &#8220;do it ALL&#8221; on Halloween, including paint faces at the ballet class Halloween party, attend the Halloween dance with Chloe and Zoey dressed as a bag of trash, and attend the Halloween dance as Brandon&#8217;s date, dressed as Shakespeare&#8217;s Juliet. Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you took on too much at one time? Were you successful? How would you do it differently if you had to do it over again? </br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 3: Tales from a Not-So-Talented Pop Star</b></i></br> </br> 1. Nikki discusses some of her fears in <i>Dork Diaries 3</i>. What was your biggest fear when you were little? What about now? </br> </br> 2. Why do you think Nikki&#8217;s parents decide to deliberately create Family Sharing Time? Does your family do anything like this? Nikki suggests her family do an extreme sport, like bungee jumping, together. What are some activities that you think would be good for Family Sharing Time? Why? </br> </br> 3. Nikki worries a lot about being seen doing things like dancing at Queasy Cheesy or getting dropped off in the roach van. Why can a situation be okay when nobody sees, but humiliating if observed? Why do we care? </br> </br> 4. Nikki doesn&#8217;t approach her mom about the video problem, her dad about the bug problem, or her friends about either problem. In the previous books, Nikki has also kept her problems to herself&#8212;even though her friends constantly prove loyal and helpful. Why doesn&#8217;t Nikki share her problems with others? Find three examples in the book that support your answer(s). </br> </br> 5. Language can be very powerful. Nikki and her friends decide to embrace the label &#8220;dork&#8221; when naming their band &#8220;Dorkalicious.&#8221; What happens when someone claims what might be considered a negative label, like &#8220;dork,&#8221; with pride? </br> </br> 6. Nikki writes that she is not jealous, because &#8220;How juvenile would THAT be?!&#8221; Her denial seems a bit too passionate to be believed, though. Do you ever get jealous even though you know you shouldn&#8217;t? How do you deal? </br> </br> 7. Nikki&#8217;s eccentric grandmother comes to visit for Thanksgiving. We learn that she belongs to an elderly Segway gang and takes road trips. If you have grandparents or older friends/family in your life, what do their lives look like? How are they similar to and different from Nikki&#8217;s grandma? What characteristic of theirs would you most like to possess when you get older? </br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 3 1/2: How to Dork Your Diary</b></i></br> </br> 1. Take the &#8220;Discover Your Diary Identity&#8221; quiz in the book. Do you think the result accurately describes your personality? How would YOU describe your personality and habits? Is Nikki's suggested diary-keeping format (based on your quiz results) the one you would be most likely to use for keeping a diary? Why or why not? Can you think of any other ways someone could keep track of their daily thoughts, emotions, and activities? </br> </br> 2. Why do you think Nikki writes, &#8220;Make sure you write in your diary every single day&#8221; even if you lose the original diary and have to write in a spare notebook? Why is keeping a diary important? </br> </br> 3. Several times in this book, Nikki initially discounts her friends&#8217; assistance and then is pleasantly surprised by the help and support they offer. For example, Nikki finally shares her problem with Chloe and Zoey and feels so relieved to have their help. When Nikki finally pays attention to the gift Brandon is trying to give her, it turns out to be really sweet and helpful. Have you ever discounted a friend's assistance at first and later accepted it? What happened? How did you feel? </br> </br> 4. Chloe goes Dumpster diving in search of Nikki&#8217;s diary. You&#8217;ve probably heard the saying that one man&#8217;s trash is another man&#8217;s treasure. If you cleaned out your old &#8220;junk,&#8221; unwanted gifts, and outgrown clothes to sell or donate, what kinds of things would you get rid of? What would you be delighted to spot at a garage sale or discarded at the side of the road? </br> </br> 5. Tongue-tied at being discovered in the boys&#8217; locker room, Zoey blurts out a quote from former President Franklin D. Roosevelt: &#8220;Men are not prisoners of fate, but only prisoners of their own minds.&#8221; In his first inaugural address, FDR also said, &#8220;the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.&#8221; What do you think these two quotes mean? </br> </br> 6. This whole book is about Nikki&#8217;s missing diary. What would you do if your diary went missing? Where would you look? Who would you blame? Even if you don&#8217;t keep a diary, imagine you discovered that everyone at school suddenly knew one of your biggest secrets. How do you think that could happen? How would you respond? </br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 4: Tales from a Not-So-Graceful Ice Princess</b></i></br> </br> 1. Have you ever felt completely overwhelmed by the task ahead of you? What would it take for you to step up to a challenge that previously seemed impossible? What techniques can make a large task more manageable? </br> </br> 2. Nikki decides she must beg MacKenzie to skate in her place, so they&#8217;ll be able to earn money for Fuzzy Friends. Have you ever had to put your group&#8217;s success above your personal desires or your ego? Why? What did that feel like? If you haven&#8217;t ever done so, in what circumstances do you think you would? Would it be easy or hard for you? </br> </br> 3. Nikki loves <i>Lady and the Tramp </i>and easily imagines herself in the classic romantic spaghetti dinner scene. What&#8217;s your favorite movie from childhood? How could you imagine yourself in a scene? Describe the setting and any friends you would cast beside you. Would you tweak anything from the original script, or would it play out pretty much the same in your life? </br> </br> 4. Even though MacKenzie cheats and pulls all kinds of mean tricks on Nikki, Nikki explains that because she wants to &#8220;be nice and show good sportsmanship,&#8221; she chooses not to taunt MacKenzie about the competition results. How do you define good sportsmanship? Provide three examples each of good and bad sportsmanship. </br> </br> 5. MacKenzie&#8217;s behavior to Nikki and her friends throughout the Dork Diaries series could be considered not just bad sportsmanship but actual bullying. Have you ever been bullied or acted like a bully? Why do you think people bully others? What is the best way to respond to a bully? </br> </br> 6. Nikki feels like she can&#8217;t ask Brandon what his hug means because doing so would betray her interest, so she feigns nonchalance and overanalyzes inside. Have you ever wanted to know something but been embarrassed or afraid even to admit you wanted to know? What, if anything, did you do to try to find out the answer to your question? </br> </br> 7. Nikki keeps Brandon&#8217;s secret, and she doesn&#8217;t even tell him that she knows. If you discovered a big secret about one of your friends, what would you do? </br> </br> 8. Nikki and her friends help in the library and read a lot. Throughout the Dork Diaries series, they refer to various trends in literature, film, and popular culture, like vampires, werewolves, and zombies. What is your favorite current trend? Least favorite? Why? </br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 5: Tales from a Not-So-Smart Miss Know-It-All</b></i></br> </br> 1. Nikki, Chloe, and Zoey each describe the characteristics for their ideal boyfriends. What would be the most important ingredients for your dream date? Why? </br> </br> 2. During their New Year&#8217;s Eve sleepover, the three girls play Truth or Dare. Which do you think takes more courage, sharing some information or doing some deed? Why? Why do you think this game remains popular over time? </br> </br> 3. The more Nikki considers all the ways MacKenzie has mistreated her, the more she thinks maybe Zoey is right that it&#8217;s time for payback. How can your friends affect your decision-making? Is there a line that, once crossed, would tempt you to seek revenge? Can you relate to Nikki&#8217;s description of ignoring the little voice of caution in your head? If so, how do you normally feel afterwards? </br> </br> 4. In the book, there is a list of positions on Nikki&#8217;s school newspaper available for new students. What role would you want on a school newspaper? Why? What role would you be least comfortable serving in, and why? </br> </br> 5. Nikki asks her best friends for advice. Their classmates write Miss Know-It-All for advice. Who can you ask for advice? Do you ask different people in different situations, or do you have one go-to person for most any problem? Does anybody come to you for advice? Why or why not? </br> </br> 6. Throughout the Dork Diaries series, Nikki has given many different kinds of gifts to her friends and family, including budget-saving handmade items, last-minute convenience presents, cherished items that are hard to share, and gifts that might also benefit her&#8212;like a dinner gift certificate for two. How do you decide what presents to give your friends and family? What&#8217;s the best gift you&#8217;ve ever given? The worst? </br> </br> </br> <b><u>A Note for Teachers</b></u></br> </br> This discussion guide is designed to help your students engage with the text through discussion in small or large groups.

      <d104><![CDATA[Discussion Questions for:</br> </br> <b>Dork Diaries</b></br> By Rachel Ren&#233;e Russell</br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 1: Tales from a Not-So-Fabulous Life</b></i></br> </br> 1. Nikki is starting at a new private school. How does she learn about the culture of the school and figure out who is trustworthy? Have you ever had to start over at a new school? If yes, how did it feel? If no, how do you think you would act the first few days? </br> </br> 2. When Nikki&#8217;s mom tells her she&#8217;s getting a back-to-school present that will help her &#8220;communicate her thoughts and feelings,&#8221; she is so excited because she thinks it will be a new cell phone. Instead, Nikki&#8217;s mom gives her a diary. Nikki is incredibly disappointed, not just because she didn&#8217;t get a cell phone, but also because she thinks a paper diary is outdated. Despite her initial resistance, Nikki ends up writing a lot in her diary. Do you think paper diaries are outdated? Would you rather share your thoughts and commentary about school life privately in a diary, or more publicly using an online forum such as a blog or social networking site like Facebook? </br> </br> 3. Nikki feels that her bedroom should be her own private space. At school, she, Chloe, and Zoey use the janitor&#8217;s closet for their meetings. Do you have your own bedroom or another special space that feels like it is all your own? If so, who makes up the rules for this special place? If you could have complete dominion over your space, what would be your top three rules? </br> </br> 4. At first, Nikki thinks Chloe and Zoey are kind of annoying, but she gets past her first impression of the pair when they all bond over their shared dislike of MacKenzie. As the story progresses and they become closer friends, we see more of their shared interests and also their differences. What do you think makes a good friend? How do the girls demonstrate these characteristics? </br> </br> 5. Sometimes family or close friends develop their own special ways of communicating through shared gestures and vocabulary, secret handshakes, and other signals. For Nikki, Chloe, and Zoey, the language of friendship already includes jazz hands, the stinkeye, and a lot of acronyms like CCPS (Cute, Cool, and Popular), 4Fs (Friends, Fun, Fashion, and Flirting), and GGG-ing (Giggling, Gossiping, and Glossing). Some of them come from magazines or popular culture, and some seem to be the girls&#8217; own inventions. What are some of your favorite words, phrases, gestures, and inside jokes you share with your family or friends? </br> </br> 6. Do you think the &#8220;thank you for the oatmeal&#8221; note Nikki&#8217;s mom leaves is sincere, or is she trying to let Nikki know that she is on to her deception but forgives her? Either way, Nikki is very relieved that she&#8217;s not in trouble. Have you had a close call where you thought you were busted but ended up being just fine? What happened? </br> </br> 7. Several times when Nikki is writing about a conversation from earlier in the day, she includes her own very honest and blunt reply, then explains, &#8220;But I just say it inside my head, so no one really hears it except me.&#8221; When is it good to self-censor? When would it be better to speak up? How can we learn to tell the difference? </br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 2: Tales from a Not-So-Popular Party Girl</b></i></br> </br> 1. Nikki&#8217;s arch nemesis MacKenzie continues torturing her in this second Dork Diaries volume by calling her names, making fun of her clothes, and dissing her friends and artistic talent. Do you have an arch nemesis? What makes this person your ultimate rival? What would you do if you had lockers next to each other? </br> </br> 2. Nikki finds out that she won $500 in the Avant-garde Art Contest. She had originally planned to use the money to buy a cell phone, but decided instead to save the money for art camp next summer. If you won $500, what would you do with it? </br> </br> 3. Nikki admits that her major crush on Brandon has caused RCS (Roller Coaster Syndrome). What does this mean? Have you ever had this feeling when you are around someone you have a crush on? Does it impact your ability to talk to him or her? </br> </br> 4. Throughout the book, Nikki continually talks about how she is so unpopular, ranking herself lower on the WCD CCP Popularity Index Chart than the school janitor, school mascot, and head lunch lady. In fact, she calls her own diary the &#8220;Dork Diary,&#8221; and often refers to herself as a dork throughout the book. However, Nikki has several best friends and a popular boy has a crush on her. How do you define popularity? Who determines who is popular at your school? Do you think how you view yourself impacts how others view you? </br> </br> 5. Nikki&#8217;s mom always wanted to be a ballerina, so she signed up both her daughters for lessons, even though neither of them wanted to attend ballet classes. Have your parents ever forced you to do something you didn&#8217;t want to do? How did you respond? </br> </br> 6. During MacKenzie&#8217;s party, Jessica &#8220;accidentally&#8221; bumps Nikki&#8217;s plate of fruit and chocolate, causing the entire plate of food to spill all over Nikki&#8217;s new party dress in front of everyone. Out of embarrassment, Nikki leaves the party and doesn&#8217;t even take the opportunity to talk to her crush Brandon, as she is waiting around outside for her dad to pick her up. Have you ever been embarrassed by someone else in front of your peers? How did you handle it? If you could go back and respond differently, would you? What would you do differently? </br> </br> 7. In response to her little sister&#8217;s fairy phobia and constant pleas for a bathroom monitor in the middle of the night, Nikki comes up with a plan to banish the imaginary tooth fairy in Brianna&#8217;s room for good using a homemade repellent made with water, vinegar, tuna fish oil, sardine oil, and garlic. What&#8217;s the most unusual thing you have ever done to get your brother or sister to stop bothering you? </br> </br> 8. In Nikki&#8217;s own words, she was trying to &#8220;do it ALL&#8221; on Halloween, including paint faces at the ballet class Halloween party, attend the Halloween dance with Chloe and Zoey dressed as a bag of trash, and attend the Halloween dance as Brandon&#8217;s date, dressed as Shakespeare&#8217;s Juliet. Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you took on too much at one time? Were you successful? How would you do it differently if you had to do it over again? </br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 3: Tales from a Not-So-Talented Pop Star</b></i></br> </br> 1. Nikki discusses some of her fears in <i>Dork Diaries 3</i>. What was your biggest fear when you were little? What about now? </br> </br> 2. Why do you think Nikki&#8217;s parents decide to deliberately create Family Sharing Time? Does your family do anything like this? Nikki suggests her family do an extreme sport, like bungee jumping, together. What are some activities that you think would be good for Family Sharing Time? Why? </br> </br> 3. Nikki worries a lot about being seen doing things like dancing at Queasy Cheesy or getting dropped off in the roach van. Why can a situation be okay when nobody sees, but humiliating if observed? Why do we care? </br> </br> 4. Nikki doesn&#8217;t approach her mom about the video problem, her dad about the bug problem, or her friends about either problem. In the previous books, Nikki has also kept her problems to herself&#8212;even though her friends constantly prove loyal and helpful. Why doesn&#8217;t Nikki share her problems with others? Find three examples in the book that support your answer(s). </br> </br> 5. Language can be very powerful. Nikki and her friends decide to embrace the label &#8220;dork&#8221; when naming their band &#8220;Dorkalicious.&#8221; What happens when someone claims what might be considered a negative label, like &#8220;dork,&#8221; with pride? </br> </br> 6. Nikki writes that she is not jealous, because &#8220;How juvenile would THAT be?!&#8221; Her denial seems a bit too passionate to be believed, though. Do you ever get jealous even though you know you shouldn&#8217;t? How do you deal? </br> </br> 7. Nikki&#8217;s eccentric grandmother comes to visit for Thanksgiving. We learn that she belongs to an elderly Segway gang and takes road trips. If you have grandparents or older friends/family in your life, what do their lives look like? How are they similar to and different from Nikki&#8217;s grandma? What characteristic of theirs would you most like to possess when you get older? </br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 3 1/2: How to Dork Your Diary</b></i></br> </br> 1. Take the &#8220;Discover Your Diary Identity&#8221; quiz in the book. Do you think the result accurately describes your personality? How would YOU describe your personality and habits? Is Nikki's suggested diary-keeping format (based on your quiz results) the one you would be most likely to use for keeping a diary? Why or why not? Can you think of any other ways someone could keep track of their daily thoughts, emotions, and activities? </br> </br> 2. Why do you think Nikki writes, &#8220;Make sure you write in your diary every single day&#8221; even if you lose the original diary and have to write in a spare notebook? Why is keeping a diary important? </br> </br> 3. Several times in this book, Nikki initially discounts her friends&#8217; assistance and then is pleasantly surprised by the help and support they offer. For example, Nikki finally shares her problem with Chloe and Zoey and feels so relieved to have their help. When Nikki finally pays attention to the gift Brandon is trying to give her, it turns out to be really sweet and helpful. Have you ever discounted a friend's assistance at first and later accepted it? What happened? How did you feel? </br> </br> 4. Chloe goes Dumpster diving in search of Nikki&#8217;s diary. You&#8217;ve probably heard the saying that one man&#8217;s trash is another man&#8217;s treasure. If you cleaned out your old &#8220;junk,&#8221; unwanted gifts, and outgrown clothes to sell or donate, what kinds of things would you get rid of? What would you be delighted to spot at a garage sale or discarded at the side of the road? </br> </br> 5. Tongue-tied at being discovered in the boys&#8217; locker room, Zoey blurts out a quote from former President Franklin D. Roosevelt: &#8220;Men are not prisoners of fate, but only prisoners of their own minds.&#8221; In his first inaugural address, FDR also said, &#8220;the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.&#8221; What do you think these two quotes mean? </br> </br> 6. This whole book is about Nikki&#8217;s missing diary. What would you do if your diary went missing? Where would you look? Who would you blame? Even if you don&#8217;t keep a diary, imagine you discovered that everyone at school suddenly knew one of your biggest secrets. How do you think that could happen? How would you respond? </br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 4: Tales from a Not-So-Graceful Ice Princess</b></i></br> </br> 1. Have you ever felt completely overwhelmed by the task ahead of you? What would it take for you to step up to a challenge that previously seemed impossible? What techniques can make a large task more manageable? </br> </br> 2. Nikki decides she must beg MacKenzie to skate in her place, so they&#8217;ll be able to earn money for Fuzzy Friends. Have you ever had to put your group&#8217;s success above your personal desires or your ego? Why? What did that feel like? If you haven&#8217;t ever done so, in what circumstances do you think you would? Would it be easy or hard for you? </br> </br> 3. Nikki loves <i>Lady and the Tramp </i>and easily imagines herself in the classic romantic spaghetti dinner scene. What&#8217;s your favorite movie from childhood? How could you imagine yourself in a scene? Describe the setting and any friends you would cast beside you. Would you tweak anything from the original script, or would it play out pretty much the same in your life? </br> </br> 4. Even though MacKenzie cheats and pulls all kinds of mean tricks on Nikki, Nikki explains that because she wants to &#8220;be nice and show good sportsmanship,&#8221; she chooses not to taunt MacKenzie about the competition results. How do you define good sportsmanship? Provide three examples each of good and bad sportsmanship. </br> </br> 5. MacKenzie&#8217;s behavior to Nikki and her friends throughout the Dork Diaries series could be considered not just bad sportsmanship but actual bullying. Have you ever been bullied or acted like a bully? Why do you think people bully others? What is the best way to respond to a bully? </br> </br> 6. Nikki feels like she can&#8217;t ask Brandon what his hug means because doing so would betray her interest, so she feigns nonchalance and overanalyzes inside. Have you ever wanted to know something but been embarrassed or afraid even to admit you wanted to know? What, if anything, did you do to try to find out the answer to your question? </br> </br> 7. Nikki keeps Brandon&#8217;s secret, and she doesn&#8217;t even tell him that she knows. If you discovered a big secret about one of your friends, what would you do? </br> </br> 8. Nikki and her friends help in the library and read a lot. Throughout the Dork Diaries series, they refer to various trends in literature, film, and popular culture, like vampires, werewolves, and zombies. What is your favorite current trend? Least favorite? Why? </br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 5: Tales from a Not-So-Smart Miss Know-It-All</b></i></br> </br> 1. Nikki, Chloe, and Zoey each describe the characteristics for their ideal boyfriends. What would be the most important ingredients for your dream date? Why? </br> </br> 2. During their New Year&#8217;s Eve sleepover, the three girls play Truth or Dare. Which do you think takes more courage, sharing some information or doing some deed? Why? Why do you think this game remains popular over time? </br> </br> 3. The more Nikki considers all the ways MacKenzie has mistreated her, the more she thinks maybe Zoey is right that it&#8217;s time for payback. How can your friends affect your decision-making? Is there a line that, once crossed, would tempt you to seek revenge? Can you relate to Nikki&#8217;s description of ignoring the little voice of caution in your head? If so, how do you normally feel afterwards? </br> </br> 4. In the book, there is a list of positions on Nikki&#8217;s school newspaper available for new students. What role would you want on a school newspaper? Why? What role would you be least comfortable serving in, and why? </br> </br> 5. Nikki asks her best friends for advice. Their classmates write Miss Know-It-All for advice. Who can you ask for advice? Do you ask different people in different situations, or do you have one go-to person for most any problem? Does anybody come to you for advice? Why or why not? </br> </br> 6. Throughout the Dork Diaries series, Nikki has given many different kinds of gifts to her friends and family, including budget-saving handmade items, last-minute convenience presents, cherished items that are hard to share, and gifts that might also benefit her&#8212;like a dinner gift certificate for two. How do you decide what presents to give your friends and family? What&#8217;s the best gift you&#8217;ve ever given? The worst? </br> </br> </br> <b><u>A Note for Teachers</b></u></br> </br> This discussion guide is designed to help your students engage with the text through discussion in small or large groups.

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>What if you learned that your fianc&#233; was not who he claimed to be? </b><BR><BR>Engaged to the charming and seductive Greg Anders, Sara Shaw is happily anticipating her wedding in Edilean, Virginia. The date has been set, the flowers ordered, even her heirloom dress is ready. But just three weeks before the wedding, Greg gets a telephone call during the night and leaves without explanation. Two days later, a man climbs up through a trapdoor in the floor of Sara&rsquo;s apartment, claiming that he is the brother of her best friend and that he&rsquo;s moving in. While Mike Newland is indeed telling the truth about his identity, his reason for being there reaches far deeper. He&rsquo;s an undercover detective, and his assignment is to use Sara to track down a woman who is one of the most notorious criminals in the United States&#8212;and also happens to be the mother of the man Sara plans to marry.<BR> <BR> Mike thinks the job will be easy&#8212;if he can figure out how to make a &ldquo;good&rdquo; girl like Sara trust him, that is. But Mike has no idea what this mission has in store for him. He&rsquo;s worked hard to keep private his connections to Edilean, which date back to his grandmother&rsquo;s time there in 1941. But as Mike and Sara get to know each other, he can&rsquo;t help but share secrets about himself that he&rsquo;s told no one else. And in return, Sara opens up to Mike about things she could never reveal to Greg. As the pair work together to solve two mysteries, their growing love begins to heal each of them in ways they never could have imagined.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>The <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Jude Deveraux brings a &ldquo;wonderful addition&rdquo; (<i>Booklist</i>) to her Montgomery/Taggert Family series with this supernatural romance in which, with the help of a feisty ghost, a man uncovers the secrets that led to the tragic death of his fianc&#233;e.</b><BR><BR>After three years, Jace Montgomery is still grieving over his fianc&#233;e Stacy&rsquo;s mysterious suicide. He hasn&rsquo;t been interested in another woman since her passing, and her family still blames him for her death. <BR> <BR>While flipping through one of her old paperbacks, Jace discovers a photo of a house stuck between the pages, bearing the cryptic message: &ldquo;Ours again. Together forever. See you there.&rdquo; The note was dated the day before her death. Obsessed by the possibility of understanding her suicide, Jace seeks out the property&#8212;Priory House, a big brick fortress in Margate, England&#8212;and buys it. <BR> <BR>It doesn&rsquo;t take long to learn that the house is haunted by a headstrong and feisty ghost, Ann Stuart, whom he must tangle with if he&rsquo;s ever to solve the mystery. Ann died under circumstances similar to those of his late fianc&#233;e, and he has a hunch that there is a connection between the two. Through his own investigations and with the help of a beautiful foreign correspondent, Jace is forced to reconcile his fianc&#233;e&rsquo;s life and her death. What follows is a satisfying and seductive discovery of both time and love by one of America&rsquo;s favorite storytellers.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[Discussion Questions for:</br> </br> <b>Dork Diaries</b></br> By Rachel Ren&#233;e Russell</br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 1: Tales from a Not-So-Fabulous Life</b></i></br> </br> 1. Nikki is starting at a new private school. How does she learn about the culture of the school and figure out who is trustworthy? Have you ever had to start over at a new school? If yes, how did it feel? If no, how do you think you would act the first few days? </br> </br> 2. When Nikki&#8217;s mom tells her she&#8217;s getting a back-to-school present that will help her &#8220;communicate her thoughts and feelings,&#8221; she is so excited because she thinks it will be a new cell phone. Instead, Nikki&#8217;s mom gives her a diary. Nikki is incredibly disappointed, not just because she didn&#8217;t get a cell phone, but also because she thinks a paper diary is outdated. Despite her initial resistance, Nikki ends up writing a lot in her diary. Do you think paper diaries are outdated? Would you rather share your thoughts and commentary about school life privately in a diary, or more publicly using an online forum such as a blog or social networking site like Facebook? </br> </br> 3. Nikki feels that her bedroom should be her own private space. At school, she, Chloe, and Zoey use the janitor&#8217;s closet for their meetings. Do you have your own bedroom or another special space that feels like it is all your own? If so, who makes up the rules for this special place? If you could have complete dominion over your space, what would be your top three rules? </br> </br> 4. At first, Nikki thinks Chloe and Zoey are kind of annoying, but she gets past her first impression of the pair when they all bond over their shared dislike of MacKenzie. As the story progresses and they become closer friends, we see more of their shared interests and also their differences. What do you think makes a good friend? How do the girls demonstrate these characteristics? </br> </br> 5. Sometimes family or close friends develop their own special ways of communicating through shared gestures and vocabulary, secret handshakes, and other signals. For Nikki, Chloe, and Zoey, the language of friendship already includes jazz hands, the stinkeye, and a lot of acronyms like CCPS (Cute, Cool, and Popular), 4Fs (Friends, Fun, Fashion, and Flirting), and GGG-ing (Giggling, Gossiping, and Glossing). Some of them come from magazines or popular culture, and some seem to be the girls&#8217; own inventions. What are some of your favorite words, phrases, gestures, and inside jokes you share with your family or friends? </br> </br> 6. Do you think the &#8220;thank you for the oatmeal&#8221; note Nikki&#8217;s mom leaves is sincere, or is she trying to let Nikki know that she is on to her deception but forgives her? Either way, Nikki is very relieved that she&#8217;s not in trouble. Have you had a close call where you thought you were busted but ended up being just fine? What happened? </br> </br> 7. Several times when Nikki is writing about a conversation from earlier in the day, she includes her own very honest and blunt reply, then explains, &#8220;But I just say it inside my head, so no one really hears it except me.&#8221; When is it good to self-censor? When would it be better to speak up? How can we learn to tell the difference? </br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 2: Tales from a Not-So-Popular Party Girl</b></i></br> </br> 1. Nikki&#8217;s arch nemesis MacKenzie continues torturing her in this second Dork Diaries volume by calling her names, making fun of her clothes, and dissing her friends and artistic talent. Do you have an arch nemesis? What makes this person your ultimate rival? What would you do if you had lockers next to each other? </br> </br> 2. Nikki finds out that she won $500 in the Avant-garde Art Contest. She had originally planned to use the money to buy a cell phone, but decided instead to save the money for art camp next summer. If you won $500, what would you do with it? </br> </br> 3. Nikki admits that her major crush on Brandon has caused RCS (Roller Coaster Syndrome). What does this mean? Have you ever had this feeling when you are around someone you have a crush on? Does it impact your ability to talk to him or her? </br> </br> 4. Throughout the book, Nikki continually talks about how she is so unpopular, ranking herself lower on the WCD CCP Popularity Index Chart than the school janitor, school mascot, and head lunch lady. In fact, she calls her own diary the &#8220;Dork Diary,&#8221; and often refers to herself as a dork throughout the book. However, Nikki has several best friends and a popular boy has a crush on her. How do you define popularity? Who determines who is popular at your school? Do you think how you view yourself impacts how others view you? </br> </br> 5. Nikki&#8217;s mom always wanted to be a ballerina, so she signed up both her daughters for lessons, even though neither of them wanted to attend ballet classes. Have your parents ever forced you to do something you didn&#8217;t want to do? How did you respond? </br> </br> 6. During MacKenzie&#8217;s party, Jessica &#8220;accidentally&#8221; bumps Nikki&#8217;s plate of fruit and chocolate, causing the entire plate of food to spill all over Nikki&#8217;s new party dress in front of everyone. Out of embarrassment, Nikki leaves the party and doesn&#8217;t even take the opportunity to talk to her crush Brandon, as she is waiting around outside for her dad to pick her up. Have you ever been embarrassed by someone else in front of your peers? How did you handle it? If you could go back and respond differently, would you? What would you do differently? </br> </br> 7. In response to her little sister&#8217;s fairy phobia and constant pleas for a bathroom monitor in the middle of the night, Nikki comes up with a plan to banish the imaginary tooth fairy in Brianna&#8217;s room for good using a homemade repellent made with water, vinegar, tuna fish oil, sardine oil, and garlic. What&#8217;s the most unusual thing you have ever done to get your brother or sister to stop bothering you? </br> </br> 8. In Nikki&#8217;s own words, she was trying to &#8220;do it ALL&#8221; on Halloween, including paint faces at the ballet class Halloween party, attend the Halloween dance with Chloe and Zoey dressed as a bag of trash, and attend the Halloween dance as Brandon&#8217;s date, dressed as Shakespeare&#8217;s Juliet. Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you took on too much at one time? Were you successful? How would you do it differently if you had to do it over again? </br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 3: Tales from a Not-So-Talented Pop Star</b></i></br> </br> 1. Nikki discusses some of her fears in <i>Dork Diaries 3</i>. What was your biggest fear when you were little? What about now? </br> </br> 2. Why do you think Nikki&#8217;s parents decide to deliberately create Family Sharing Time? Does your family do anything like this? Nikki suggests her family do an extreme sport, like bungee jumping, together. What are some activities that you think would be good for Family Sharing Time? Why? </br> </br> 3. Nikki worries a lot about being seen doing things like dancing at Queasy Cheesy or getting dropped off in the roach van. Why can a situation be okay when nobody sees, but humiliating if observed? Why do we care? </br> </br> 4. Nikki doesn&#8217;t approach her mom about the video problem, her dad about the bug problem, or her friends about either problem. In the previous books, Nikki has also kept her problems to herself&#8212;even though her friends constantly prove loyal and helpful. Why doesn&#8217;t Nikki share her problems with others? Find three examples in the book that support your answer(s). </br> </br> 5. Language can be very powerful. Nikki and her friends decide to embrace the label &#8220;dork&#8221; when naming their band &#8220;Dorkalicious.&#8221; What happens when someone claims what might be considered a negative label, like &#8220;dork,&#8221; with pride? </br> </br> 6. Nikki writes that she is not jealous, because &#8220;How juvenile would THAT be?!&#8221; Her denial seems a bit too passionate to be believed, though. Do you ever get jealous even though you know you shouldn&#8217;t? How do you deal? </br> </br> 7. Nikki&#8217;s eccentric grandmother comes to visit for Thanksgiving. We learn that she belongs to an elderly Segway gang and takes road trips. If you have grandparents or older friends/family in your life, what do their lives look like? How are they similar to and different from Nikki&#8217;s grandma? What characteristic of theirs would you most like to possess when you get older? </br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 3 1/2: How to Dork Your Diary</b></i></br> </br> 1. Take the &#8220;Discover Your Diary Identity&#8221; quiz in the book. Do you think the result accurately describes your personality? How would YOU describe your personality and habits? Is Nikki's suggested diary-keeping format (based on your quiz results) the one you would be most likely to use for keeping a diary? Why or why not? Can you think of any other ways someone could keep track of their daily thoughts, emotions, and activities? </br> </br> 2. Why do you think Nikki writes, &#8220;Make sure you write in your diary every single day&#8221; even if you lose the original diary and have to write in a spare notebook? Why is keeping a diary important? </br> </br> 3. Several times in this book, Nikki initially discounts her friends&#8217; assistance and then is pleasantly surprised by the help and support they offer. For example, Nikki finally shares her problem with Chloe and Zoey and feels so relieved to have their help. When Nikki finally pays attention to the gift Brandon is trying to give her, it turns out to be really sweet and helpful. Have you ever discounted a friend's assistance at first and later accepted it? What happened? How did you feel? </br> </br> 4. Chloe goes Dumpster diving in search of Nikki&#8217;s diary. You&#8217;ve probably heard the saying that one man&#8217;s trash is another man&#8217;s treasure. If you cleaned out your old &#8220;junk,&#8221; unwanted gifts, and outgrown clothes to sell or donate, what kinds of things would you get rid of? What would you be delighted to spot at a garage sale or discarded at the side of the road? </br> </br> 5. Tongue-tied at being discovered in the boys&#8217; locker room, Zoey blurts out a quote from former President Franklin D. Roosevelt: &#8220;Men are not prisoners of fate, but only prisoners of their own minds.&#8221; In his first inaugural address, FDR also said, &#8220;the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.&#8221; What do you think these two quotes mean? </br> </br> 6. This whole book is about Nikki&#8217;s missing diary. What would you do if your diary went missing? Where would you look? Who would you blame? Even if you don&#8217;t keep a diary, imagine you discovered that everyone at school suddenly knew one of your biggest secrets. How do you think that could happen? How would you respond? </br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 4: Tales from a Not-So-Graceful Ice Princess</b></i></br> </br> 1. Have you ever felt completely overwhelmed by the task ahead of you? What would it take for you to step up to a challenge that previously seemed impossible? What techniques can make a large task more manageable? </br> </br> 2. Nikki decides she must beg MacKenzie to skate in her place, so they&#8217;ll be able to earn money for Fuzzy Friends. Have you ever had to put your group&#8217;s success above your personal desires or your ego? Why? What did that feel like? If you haven&#8217;t ever done so, in what circumstances do you think you would? Would it be easy or hard for you? </br> </br> 3. Nikki loves <i>Lady and the Tramp </i>and easily imagines herself in the classic romantic spaghetti dinner scene. What&#8217;s your favorite movie from childhood? How could you imagine yourself in a scene? Describe the setting and any friends you would cast beside you. Would you tweak anything from the original script, or would it play out pretty much the same in your life? </br> </br> 4. Even though MacKenzie cheats and pulls all kinds of mean tricks on Nikki, Nikki explains that because she wants to &#8220;be nice and show good sportsmanship,&#8221; she chooses not to taunt MacKenzie about the competition results. How do you define good sportsmanship? Provide three examples each of good and bad sportsmanship. </br> </br> 5. MacKenzie&#8217;s behavior to Nikki and her friends throughout the Dork Diaries series could be considered not just bad sportsmanship but actual bullying. Have you ever been bullied or acted like a bully? Why do you think people bully others? What is the best way to respond to a bully? </br> </br> 6. Nikki feels like she can&#8217;t ask Brandon what his hug means because doing so would betray her interest, so she feigns nonchalance and overanalyzes inside. Have you ever wanted to know something but been embarrassed or afraid even to admit you wanted to know? What, if anything, did you do to try to find out the answer to your question? </br> </br> 7. Nikki keeps Brandon&#8217;s secret, and she doesn&#8217;t even tell him that she knows. If you discovered a big secret about one of your friends, what would you do? </br> </br> 8. Nikki and her friends help in the library and read a lot. Throughout the Dork Diaries series, they refer to various trends in literature, film, and popular culture, like vampires, werewolves, and zombies. What is your favorite current trend? Least favorite? Why? </br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 5: Tales from a Not-So-Smart Miss Know-It-All</b></i></br> </br> 1. Nikki, Chloe, and Zoey each describe the characteristics for their ideal boyfriends. What would be the most important ingredients for your dream date? Why? </br> </br> 2. During their New Year&#8217;s Eve sleepover, the three girls play Truth or Dare. Which do you think takes more courage, sharing some information or doing some deed? Why? Why do you think this game remains popular over time? </br> </br> 3. The more Nikki considers all the ways MacKenzie has mistreated her, the more she thinks maybe Zoey is right that it&#8217;s time for payback. How can your friends affect your decision-making? Is there a line that, once crossed, would tempt you to seek revenge? Can you relate to Nikki&#8217;s description of ignoring the little voice of caution in your head? If so, how do you normally feel afterwards? </br> </br> 4. In the book, there is a list of positions on Nikki&#8217;s school newspaper available for new students. What role would you want on a school newspaper? Why? What role would you be least comfortable serving in, and why? </br> </br> 5. Nikki asks her best friends for advice. Their classmates write Miss Know-It-All for advice. Who can you ask for advice? Do you ask different people in different situations, or do you have one go-to person for most any problem? Does anybody come to you for advice? Why or why not? </br> </br> 6. Throughout the Dork Diaries series, Nikki has given many different kinds of gifts to her friends and family, including budget-saving handmade items, last-minute convenience presents, cherished items that are hard to share, and gifts that might also benefit her&#8212;like a dinner gift certificate for two. How do you decide what presents to give your friends and family? What&#8217;s the best gift you&#8217;ve ever given? The worst? </br> </br> </br> <b><u>A Note for Teachers</b></u></br> </br> This discussion guide is designed to help your students engage with the text through discussion in small or large groups.

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>&ldquo;Filled with the vitality and spirit that made Jack Kennedy such a magical figure. Chris Matthews shows the cunning and determination beneath that magic. It&rsquo;s an awesome and delightful book.&rdquo; &#8212;Walter Isaacson, author of <i>Steve Jobs</i></b><BR><BR><i>&ldquo;What was he like?&rdquo;</i><i> </i><BR> <BR> Jack Kennedy said the reason people read biography is to answer that basic question. What was he like, this man whose own wife called him &ldquo;that elusive, unforgettable man?&rdquo; In this <i>New York Times </i>bestselling biography, Chris Matthews answers that question with the verve of a novelist. We see this most beloved president in the company of friends. We see and feel him close-up, having fun and giving off that restlessness of his. We watch him navigate his life from privileged, rebellious youth to gutsy American president. We witness his bravery in war and selfless rescue of his PT boat crew. We watch JFK as a young politician learning to play hardball and watch him grow into the leader who averts a nuclear war.<BR> <BR>Matthews&rsquo;s extraordinary biography is based on personal interviews with those closest to JFK, oral histories by top political aide Kenneth O&rsquo;Donnell and others, documents from his years as a student at Choate, and notes from Jacqueline Kennedy&rsquo;s first interview after Dallas. As Matthews writes: &ldquo;I found a fighting prince never free of pain, never far from trouble, never accepting the world he found, never wanting to be his father&rsquo;s son. He was a far greater hero than he ever wished us to know.&rdquo;]]></d104>

The suggested questions are intended to help your reading group find new and interesting angles and topics for your discussion. We hope that these ideas will enrich your conversation and increase your enjoyment of the book.<BR><BR></i><BR><b>Introduction</b><BR><BR> Love Anthony is the latest novel from the award-winning, New York Times bestselling author of Still Alice and Left Neglected, about an accidental friendship forged between two women on a Nantucket beach; a friendship that provides peace to one, validation to the other. Olivia is a thirty-something mother whose eight-year-old, nonverbal autistic son has recently died. With her marriage badly strained by years of stress, she has come to the island recently separated, trying to understand the purpose of her son&#8217;s short life. Beth, a stay-at-home mother of three already living on Nantucket, is also recently separated after discovering her husband's infidelity. In an attempt to recapture a sense of her long-lost independence, she rekindles her passion for writing, determined to discover her identity again. But surprisingly, as she uncovers her own voice, Beth also finds herself channeling the voice of an unknown boy, a voice that will give both women the comfort and answers they need. &nbsp; <BR><BR><b>Topics &amp; Questions for Discussion&nbsp;</b><BR><BR> 1. How much did you know about this condition before starting Love Anthony? Do you know anyone who has autism or an autistic person in their family? <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 2. What significance does the setting of Nantucket play in this story? Would the story have been different if it had taken place in New York City or Chicago? <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 3. Beth pulls a box out of her attic, filled with remnants from her old life, and is reminded of the woman she once was. If you were to go through a box from your attic, what items might you find? <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 4. On the subject of marriage and fidelity, Beth&#8217;s friend Courtney muses: &#8220;You&#8217;re always at the mercy of the people you&#8217;re in a relationship with, right?&#8221; (p. 171) Do you agree? What do you think of the advice she offers Beth? <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 5. Do you think the author accurately captured the voice of a young autistic boy in the Anthony chapters? Did these sections enhance Beth&#8217;s story for you? What about Olivia&#8217;s journal entries? <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 6. After receiving David&#8217;s letter about his impending engagement, Olivia ponders the concept of happiness: &#8220;He&#8217;s right. I forgot about happiness. At first, it wasn&#8217;t a priority. Anthony had autism, and every ounce of energy went into saving him. Her happiness was irrelevant&#8230;.And then, just when she was starting to realize that happiness and autism could co-exist in the same room, in the same sentence, in her heart, Anthony died, and happiness was no longer a concept she could fathom.&#8221; (p. 283) Do you think happiness is a conscious choice? Do you find it telling that Olivia uses the phrase &#8220;saving him&#8221; in reference to Anthony and his autism? <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 7. Toward the end of the story, Olivia has an epiphany when she realizes that &#8220;There was more to Anthony&#8217;s life than his death. And there was more to Anthony than his autism.&#8221; (p. 283) What do you think finally enables Olivia to have this realization? Was it a singular event or a process? <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 8. When Jimmy and Beth share their homework assignments given to them by Dr. Campbell, were you surprised by Beth&#8217;s initial reaction? Why is forgiving Jimmy the one thing Beth can&#8217;t do? <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 9. After reading Beth&#8217;s novel, Olivia is convinced Anthony is speaking to her through Beth. Skeptical, Beth discusses the idea with the more spiritual Petra, who feels &#8220;we&#8217;re all connected, even if we don&#8217;t know how. Maybe communicating through you gives you the something you need in this lifetime.&#8221; (p. 308) Do you agree or disagree with Petra? <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 10. Through writing her book, Beth realizes &#8220;this story was more about Anthony the boy than Anthony the boy with autism&#8230; she was simply writing about Anthony, a boy worthy of happiness and safety, of feeling wanted and loved. Just like her. The more she wrote about Anthony, the more she realized that she was actually writing about herself.&#8221; (p. 331) How so? <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 11. Beth ultimately decides the lesson of her book is &#8220;Find someone to love and love without condition.&#8221; (p.332) Do you think this could also apply as an overall theme for Love Anthony? Can you find any others? <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 12. Which character did you relate to the most and why? Where do you see these characters in five years? <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 13. What do you think of Beth&#8217;s epilogue? Do you think it provides a satisfying ending to her story? To the novel as a whole? <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 14. Another recurring theme of Love Anthony is faith &#8211; having faith, losing faith, and taking a leap of faith. Can you remember a time in your own life when you took a leap of faith? <BR><BR><b>Enhance Your Book Club</b><BR><BR>&nbsp; 1. Visit the website http://www.autismspeaks.org to learn more about autism and different fundraising or awareness-raising events your book club can participate in. <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 2. The author is a keen public speaker and tours often with her books. Check out the author&#8217;s website, to see if she&#8217;s speaking near you: http://lisagenova.com/ <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 3. When out at Salt with her friends, Jimmy makes Beth a special drink&#8212;a Hot Passion Martini. Why not concoct a signature drink (with or without alcohol) for your book club gathering? Why not invent a &#8216;Nantucket Knockout?&#8217; &nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR><b>A Conversation with Lisa Genova&nbsp; </b><BR><BR><b> 1. You have said that Oliver Sacks, along with your grandmother&#8217;s struggle with Alzheimer&#8217;s inspired you to pen Still Alice. Was there a particular person in mind when you started Love Anthony? &nbsp;</b><BR><BR> This book began with Anthony, a boy with autism who doesn&#8217;t speak, inspired by my cousin&#8217;s beautiful autistic son, Anthony. My cousin and I are close, and my oldest daughter and Anthony are the same age. We spent much of their baby and early childhood years together. So, as with Still Alice, this story sprang from a deeply personal place. </b><BR><BR><b> 2. What kind of research did you undertake for this novel? &nbsp;</b><BR><BR> I did a lot of research on autism for this novel. I read as many books, blogs, and research articles as I could both before and while I was writing Love Anthony&#8212;from fiction to memoir to clinical texts. A list of the books I read can be found at my website. I interviewed physicians, behavioral therapists, an EMT, and people who&#8217;ve experienced seizures. The most important research involved talking with parents of children (age 3-17) with autism. These conversations were intensely personal, raw, honest, and generous. I can&#8217;t thank these parents enough for what they shared with me. &nbsp;</b><BR><BR> I also spent a lot of time researching the island of Nantucket. This involved reading many books about the island, interviewing people who live there (natives, summer people, and wash-ashores), and hopping the high speed ferry from Cape Cod to Nantucket as many times as I could throughout the year. </b><BR><BR><b> 3. Did you intend to make it a two-fold story (two characters whose lives intersect) or did that come organically? &nbsp;</b><BR><BR> This was the intention from the beginning. I did this for two reasons. One, both for the child who has it and for the families who love and advocate for them, autism can be incredibly isolating. When I talked with parents and professionals who know autism, I repeatedly heard the same words &#8211; isolated, disconnected, solitary, alone. While isolation is a very real aspect of living with autism, and I certainly needed to portray this in the book, I wanted to show people connecting (lives intersecting) through autism. Second, much of the focus on autism, especially among people who aren&#8217;t all that familiar with it (like Beth at first), is on all the ways that autistic children are different from typical children. The focus is on what is strange or abnormal or even tragic. Again, that is there, but I also wanted to shed light on what is the same among all of us, whether you have autism or not. How do we connect as human beings with each other? Are we all capable of this? What happens when we can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t or give up on connecting? What happens when we find a way to truly understand and accept each other? </b><BR><BR><b> 4. You have your degree in biopsychology and a PhD. in neuroscience. How has your education influenced your writing? &nbsp;</b><BR><BR> Neuroscience continues to be the first and foremost influence on what I&#8217;m interested in writing about. I&#8217;m definitely still a nerdy girl who loves learning about how the brain works. I love that I get to weave this passion for neuroscience into the stories I tell as a novelist. I get to ask the questions I care about most, questions about the brain and the bigger questions about life and then try to answer them as best I can through stories. I&#8217;m a lucky, nerdy girl! </b><BR><BR><b> 5. What part of the writing/publishing process do you find the most challenging, the researching, the actual writing, the editing, the public speaking at conferences and on book tours? &nbsp;</b><BR><BR> I honestly love all of those aspects of being a writer, even (and especially) the challenges. I think the most challenging part is when I have to do all of these at once! For example, many times in the past year while traveling on book tour for Left Neglected or on speaking tour for Still Alice, I would read a book about autism on the plane and then write some of Love Anthony in a Starbucks (Sydney, London, Montreal) before having to give a talk about Alzheimer&#8217;s or a book event about Left Neglected. So on any given day, I might be writing about Olivia and Anthony and autism but also talking about Alice and Alzheimer&#8217;s or Sarah and Left Neglect. </b><BR><BR><b> 6. How was the experience of writing Love Anthony different from your two previous novels, Still Alice and Left Neglected? &nbsp;</b><BR><BR> When I was writing Still Alice and Left Neglected, I always felt like I could lean on my neuroscience background when I needed it. I could go to the textbooks and the medical community for scientific information about Alzheimer&#8217;s or Neglect and traumatic brain injury, and, as a fledgling writer, I found this comforting. With Love Anthony, I was very much aware that I was writing without this safety net. There is no neuroscience textbook on autism. And the structure of this story is far more complex than my previous two books. With Still Alice and Left Neglected, I was a neuroscientist writing a novel. With Love Anthony, I became a novelist. </b><BR><BR><b> 7. Can you read other writers while you are working on a book, or do you take a sort of &#8216;media-blackout&#8217; approach? &nbsp;</b><BR><BR> I&#8217;m always reading, typically two or three books at once. While writing Love Anthony, I was always reading a book about autism&#8212;The Siege, Born on Blue Day, Making Peace with Autism, A Regular Guy, The Way I See It, Son-Rise, Thinking Person&#8217;s Guide to Autism. But I was also usually reading a novel or a memoir unrelated to autism. Right now I&#8217;m reading Mapping Fate, One Hundred Years of Solitude, and Maine. </b><BR><BR><b> 8. With Still Alice, you raised awareness to the insidious disease of Alzheimer&#8217;s, and in Left Neglected, you shed light on traumatic brain injuries. Is it your hope that Love Anthony can do the same for autism? &nbsp;</b><BR><BR> Absolutely. Scientifically and clinically speaking, we&#8217;re only beginning to understand what autism is. Most physicians were taught essentially nothing about it when they were in medical school. So in 2012, we&#8217;re in the infancy of elucidating the neuroscience of autism. Yet 1 in 88 children are on the spectrum. And each one of those children has a mother, a father, grandparents, siblings, cousins, neighbors, teachers, student peers, friends&#8212;people who are touched by autism, connected to it, and need some better understanding of what it is. I hope that Love Anthony can contribute to an increased awareness and a much-needed, better understanding of autism. </b><BR><BR><b> 9. What are you working on next? &nbsp;</b><BR><BR> My next novel is about a genetic, neurodegenerative disease and fate.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[Discussion Questions for:</br> </br> <b>Dork Diaries</b></br> By Rachel Ren&#233;e Russell</br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 1: Tales from a Not-So-Fabulous Life</b></i></br> </br> 1. Nikki is starting at a new private school. How does she learn about the culture of the school and figure out who is trustworthy? Have you ever had to start over at a new school? If yes, how did it feel? If no, how do you think you would act the first few days? </br> </br> 2. When Nikki&#8217;s mom tells her she&#8217;s getting a back-to-school present that will help her &#8220;communicate her thoughts and feelings,&#8221; she is so excited because she thinks it will be a new cell phone. Instead, Nikki&#8217;s mom gives her a diary. Nikki is incredibly disappointed, not just because she didn&#8217;t get a cell phone, but also because she thinks a paper diary is outdated. Despite her initial resistance, Nikki ends up writing a lot in her diary. Do you think paper diaries are outdated? Would you rather share your thoughts and commentary about school life privately in a diary, or more publicly using an online forum such as a blog or social networking site like Facebook? </br> </br> 3. Nikki feels that her bedroom should be her own private space. At school, she, Chloe, and Zoey use the janitor&#8217;s closet for their meetings. Do you have your own bedroom or another special space that feels like it is all your own? If so, who makes up the rules for this special place? If you could have complete dominion over your space, what would be your top three rules? </br> </br> 4. At first, Nikki thinks Chloe and Zoey are kind of annoying, but she gets past her first impression of the pair when they all bond over their shared dislike of MacKenzie. As the story progresses and they become closer friends, we see more of their shared interests and also their differences. What do you think makes a good friend? How do the girls demonstrate these characteristics? </br> </br> 5. Sometimes family or close friends develop their own special ways of communicating through shared gestures and vocabulary, secret handshakes, and other signals. For Nikki, Chloe, and Zoey, the language of friendship already includes jazz hands, the stinkeye, and a lot of acronyms like CCPS (Cute, Cool, and Popular), 4Fs (Friends, Fun, Fashion, and Flirting), and GGG-ing (Giggling, Gossiping, and Glossing). Some of them come from magazines or popular culture, and some seem to be the girls&#8217; own inventions. What are some of your favorite words, phrases, gestures, and inside jokes you share with your family or friends? </br> </br> 6. Do you think the &#8220;thank you for the oatmeal&#8221; note Nikki&#8217;s mom leaves is sincere, or is she trying to let Nikki know that she is on to her deception but forgives her? Either way, Nikki is very relieved that she&#8217;s not in trouble. Have you had a close call where you thought you were busted but ended up being just fine? What happened? </br> </br> 7. Several times when Nikki is writing about a conversation from earlier in the day, she includes her own very honest and blunt reply, then explains, &#8220;But I just say it inside my head, so no one really hears it except me.&#8221; When is it good to self-censor? When would it be better to speak up? How can we learn to tell the difference? </br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 2: Tales from a Not-So-Popular Party Girl</b></i></br> </br> 1. Nikki&#8217;s arch nemesis MacKenzie continues torturing her in this second Dork Diaries volume by calling her names, making fun of her clothes, and dissing her friends and artistic talent. Do you have an arch nemesis? What makes this person your ultimate rival? What would you do if you had lockers next to each other? </br> </br> 2. Nikki finds out that she won $500 in the Avant-garde Art Contest. She had originally planned to use the money to buy a cell phone, but decided instead to save the money for art camp next summer. If you won $500, what would you do with it? </br> </br> 3. Nikki admits that her major crush on Brandon has caused RCS (Roller Coaster Syndrome). What does this mean? Have you ever had this feeling when you are around someone you have a crush on? Does it impact your ability to talk to him or her? </br> </br> 4. Throughout the book, Nikki continually talks about how she is so unpopular, ranking herself lower on the WCD CCP Popularity Index Chart than the school janitor, school mascot, and head lunch lady. In fact, she calls her own diary the &#8220;Dork Diary,&#8221; and often refers to herself as a dork throughout the book. However, Nikki has several best friends and a popular boy has a crush on her. How do you define popularity? Who determines who is popular at your school? Do you think how you view yourself impacts how others view you? </br> </br> 5. Nikki&#8217;s mom always wanted to be a ballerina, so she signed up both her daughters for lessons, even though neither of them wanted to attend ballet classes. Have your parents ever forced you to do something you didn&#8217;t want to do? How did you respond? </br> </br> 6. During MacKenzie&#8217;s party, Jessica &#8220;accidentally&#8221; bumps Nikki&#8217;s plate of fruit and chocolate, causing the entire plate of food to spill all over Nikki&#8217;s new party dress in front of everyone. Out of embarrassment, Nikki leaves the party and doesn&#8217;t even take the opportunity to talk to her crush Brandon, as she is waiting around outside for her dad to pick her up. Have you ever been embarrassed by someone else in front of your peers? How did you handle it? If you could go back and respond differently, would you? What would you do differently? </br> </br> 7. In response to her little sister&#8217;s fairy phobia and constant pleas for a bathroom monitor in the middle of the night, Nikki comes up with a plan to banish the imaginary tooth fairy in Brianna&#8217;s room for good using a homemade repellent made with water, vinegar, tuna fish oil, sardine oil, and garlic. What&#8217;s the most unusual thing you have ever done to get your brother or sister to stop bothering you? </br> </br> 8. In Nikki&#8217;s own words, she was trying to &#8220;do it ALL&#8221; on Halloween, including paint faces at the ballet class Halloween party, attend the Halloween dance with Chloe and Zoey dressed as a bag of trash, and attend the Halloween dance as Brandon&#8217;s date, dressed as Shakespeare&#8217;s Juliet. Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you took on too much at one time? Were you successful? How would you do it differently if you had to do it over again? </br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 3: Tales from a Not-So-Talented Pop Star</b></i></br> </br> 1. Nikki discusses some of her fears in <i>Dork Diaries 3</i>. What was your biggest fear when you were little? What about now? </br> </br> 2. Why do you think Nikki&#8217;s parents decide to deliberately create Family Sharing Time? Does your family do anything like this? Nikki suggests her family do an extreme sport, like bungee jumping, together. What are some activities that you think would be good for Family Sharing Time? Why? </br> </br> 3. Nikki worries a lot about being seen doing things like dancing at Queasy Cheesy or getting dropped off in the roach van. Why can a situation be okay when nobody sees, but humiliating if observed? Why do we care? </br> </br> 4. Nikki doesn&#8217;t approach her mom about the video problem, her dad about the bug problem, or her friends about either problem. In the previous books, Nikki has also kept her problems to herself&#8212;even though her friends constantly prove loyal and helpful. Why doesn&#8217;t Nikki share her problems with others? Find three examples in the book that support your answer(s). </br> </br> 5. Language can be very powerful. Nikki and her friends decide to embrace the label &#8220;dork&#8221; when naming their band &#8220;Dorkalicious.&#8221; What happens when someone claims what might be considered a negative label, like &#8220;dork,&#8221; with pride? </br> </br> 6. Nikki writes that she is not jealous, because &#8220;How juvenile would THAT be?!&#8221; Her denial seems a bit too passionate to be believed, though. Do you ever get jealous even though you know you shouldn&#8217;t? How do you deal? </br> </br> 7. Nikki&#8217;s eccentric grandmother comes to visit for Thanksgiving. We learn that she belongs to an elderly Segway gang and takes road trips. If you have grandparents or older friends/family in your life, what do their lives look like? How are they similar to and different from Nikki&#8217;s grandma? What characteristic of theirs would you most like to possess when you get older? </br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 3 1/2: How to Dork Your Diary</b></i></br> </br> 1. Take the &#8220;Discover Your Diary Identity&#8221; quiz in the book. Do you think the result accurately describes your personality? How would YOU describe your personality and habits? Is Nikki's suggested diary-keeping format (based on your quiz results) the one you would be most likely to use for keeping a diary? Why or why not? Can you think of any other ways someone could keep track of their daily thoughts, emotions, and activities? </br> </br> 2. Why do you think Nikki writes, &#8220;Make sure you write in your diary every single day&#8221; even if you lose the original diary and have to write in a spare notebook? Why is keeping a diary important? </br> </br> 3. Several times in this book, Nikki initially discounts her friends&#8217; assistance and then is pleasantly surprised by the help and support they offer. For example, Nikki finally shares her problem with Chloe and Zoey and feels so relieved to have their help. When Nikki finally pays attention to the gift Brandon is trying to give her, it turns out to be really sweet and helpful. Have you ever discounted a friend's assistance at first and later accepted it? What happened? How did you feel? </br> </br> 4. Chloe goes Dumpster diving in search of Nikki&#8217;s diary. You&#8217;ve probably heard the saying that one man&#8217;s trash is another man&#8217;s treasure. If you cleaned out your old &#8220;junk,&#8221; unwanted gifts, and outgrown clothes to sell or donate, what kinds of things would you get rid of? What would you be delighted to spot at a garage sale or discarded at the side of the road? </br> </br> 5. Tongue-tied at being discovered in the boys&#8217; locker room, Zoey blurts out a quote from former President Franklin D. Roosevelt: &#8220;Men are not prisoners of fate, but only prisoners of their own minds.&#8221; In his first inaugural address, FDR also said, &#8220;the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.&#8221; What do you think these two quotes mean? </br> </br> 6. This whole book is about Nikki&#8217;s missing diary. What would you do if your diary went missing? Where would you look? Who would you blame? Even if you don&#8217;t keep a diary, imagine you discovered that everyone at school suddenly knew one of your biggest secrets. How do you think that could happen? How would you respond? </br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 4: Tales from a Not-So-Graceful Ice Princess</b></i></br> </br> 1. Have you ever felt completely overwhelmed by the task ahead of you? What would it take for you to step up to a challenge that previously seemed impossible? What techniques can make a large task more manageable? </br> </br> 2. Nikki decides she must beg MacKenzie to skate in her place, so they&#8217;ll be able to earn money for Fuzzy Friends. Have you ever had to put your group&#8217;s success above your personal desires or your ego? Why? What did that feel like? If you haven&#8217;t ever done so, in what circumstances do you think you would? Would it be easy or hard for you? </br> </br> 3. Nikki loves <i>Lady and the Tramp </i>and easily imagines herself in the classic romantic spaghetti dinner scene. What&#8217;s your favorite movie from childhood? How could you imagine yourself in a scene? Describe the setting and any friends you would cast beside you. Would you tweak anything from the original script, or would it play out pretty much the same in your life? </br> </br> 4. Even though MacKenzie cheats and pulls all kinds of mean tricks on Nikki, Nikki explains that because she wants to &#8220;be nice and show good sportsmanship,&#8221; she chooses not to taunt MacKenzie about the competition results. How do you define good sportsmanship? Provide three examples each of good and bad sportsmanship. </br> </br> 5. MacKenzie&#8217;s behavior to Nikki and her friends throughout the Dork Diaries series could be considered not just bad sportsmanship but actual bullying. Have you ever been bullied or acted like a bully? Why do you think people bully others? What is the best way to respond to a bully? </br> </br> 6. Nikki feels like she can&#8217;t ask Brandon what his hug means because doing so would betray her interest, so she feigns nonchalance and overanalyzes inside. Have you ever wanted to know something but been embarrassed or afraid even to admit you wanted to know? What, if anything, did you do to try to find out the answer to your question? </br> </br> 7. Nikki keeps Brandon&#8217;s secret, and she doesn&#8217;t even tell him that she knows. If you discovered a big secret about one of your friends, what would you do? </br> </br> 8. Nikki and her friends help in the library and read a lot. Throughout the Dork Diaries series, they refer to various trends in literature, film, and popular culture, like vampires, werewolves, and zombies. What is your favorite current trend? Least favorite? Why? </br> </br> </br> <b><i>Dork Diaries 5: Tales from a Not-So-Smart Miss Know-It-All</b></i></br> </br> 1. Nikki, Chloe, and Zoey each describe the characteristics for their ideal boyfriends. What would be the most important ingredients for your dream date? Why? </br> </br> 2. During their New Year&#8217;s Eve sleepover, the three girls play Truth or Dare. Which do you think takes more courage, sharing some information or doing some deed? Why? Why do you think this game remains popular over time? </br> </br> 3. The more Nikki considers all the ways MacKenzie has mistreated her, the more she thinks maybe Zoey is right that it&#8217;s time for payback. How can your friends affect your decision-making? Is there a line that, once crossed, would tempt you to seek revenge? Can you relate to Nikki&#8217;s description of ignoring the little voice of caution in your head? If so, how do you normally feel afterwards? </br> </br> 4. In the book, there is a list of positions on Nikki&#8217;s school newspaper available for new students. What role would you want on a school newspaper? Why? What role would you be least comfortable serving in, and why? </br> </br> 5. Nikki asks her best friends for advice. Their classmates write Miss Know-It-All for advice. Who can you ask for advice? Do you ask different people in different situations, or do you have one go-to person for most any problem? Does anybody come to you for advice? Why or why not? </br> </br> 6. Throughout the Dork Diaries series, Nikki has given many different kinds of gifts to her friends and family, including budget-saving handmade items, last-minute convenience presents, cherished items that are hard to share, and gifts that might also benefit her&#8212;like a dinner gift certificate for two. How do you decide what presents to give your friends and family? What&#8217;s the best gift you&#8217;ve ever given? The worst? </br> </br> </br> <b><u>A Note for Teachers</b></u></br> </br> This discussion guide is designed to help your students engage with the text through discussion in small or large groups.

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>A young widow inherits a run-down farmhouse and a whole new beginning in Virginia in this charming and emotional novel from the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Summerhouse</i>. </b><BR><BR>Quiet, unassuming, and overweight, Lillian did anything and everything to please her husband of twenty years, the illustrious self-made billionaire James Manville. Since the tender age of seventeen, she had obeyed this powerful older man&rsquo;s every command and in return she received a life beyond her wildest dreams. Elaborate mansions. Trips around the world. The finest jewels and the most luxurious fashions. <BR> <BR>But when Jimmie dies suddenly in a plane crash, Lillian&rsquo;s pampered life comes to an abrupt halt. She learns that Jimmie has bequeathed all of his riches to his devious siblings. All, that is, except an old farmhouse in small-town Virginia. Although Lillian is devastated by Jimmie's death and apparent betrayal, she soon discovers a well of secrets connected to Jimmie&rsquo;s past and uncovering them, she thinks, will help her to better understand the man she loved and mysteriously lost. <BR> <BR>What Lillian doesn&rsquo;t foresee is how her unexpected circumstances quickly transform her. She loses weight, changes her name to avoid further harassment from the press, and, with the help of Matthew Longacre, a kind, handsome local man, begins to renovate the farmhouse and establish friendships with the quirky townspeople. In time she develops her own thriving business and an inner strength she never knew existed. But, though Lillian&rsquo;s new life seems as strong as the mulberry tree firmly planted outside her farmhouse, there remain secrets and lies that threaten to uproot the past she cherished and the future she will fight to protect.]]></d104>

In the orderly, evidence-based manner with which Don approaches all things, he designs the Wife Project to find his perfect partner: a sixteen-page, scientifically valid survey to filter out the drinkers, the smokers, the late arrivers.<BR> <BR>Rosie Jarman possesses all these qualities. Don easily disqualifies her as a candidate for The Wife Project (even if she is &ldquo;quite intelligent for a barmaid&rdquo;). But Don is intrigued by Rosie&rsquo;s own quest to identify her biological father.

The suggested questions are intended to help your reading group find new and interesting angles and topics for your discussion. We hope that these ideas will enrich your conversation and increase your enjoyment of the book. <BR><BR></i> <BR><b>Introduction</b><BR><BR> Professor of genetics Don Tillman&#8217;s life is turned upside down when he embarks upon the Wife Project in order to find a suitable mate for his quirky habits and demanding personality. When a psychology PhD student named Rosie walks into his office, she&#8217;s all wrong&#8212;her hair is dyed, her clothes are sloppy, she smokes, and she is habitually late. But then again, something is right about her . . . Don just can&#8217;t recognize it at first. As the Wife Project takes a back burner to Rosie&#8217;s own project of searching for her biological father, Don finds himself breaking all kinds of rules and breaking out of his routine in ways that are both uncomfortable and exciting. When a research trip takes them from Australia to New York City, and Don&#8217;s career is threatened by his allegiance to Rosie, Don must face the toughest puzzle of all&#8212;himself. In the end, Don must confront his long-held notions of what it means to love and connect with people, and what it truly means to open up and trust someone. &nbsp; <BR><BR><b>Topics &amp; Questions for Discussion&nbsp;</b><BR><BR> 1. Do Don&#8217;s Asperger&#8217;s conditions help him or hinder him? Does Don&#8217;s having Autism offer any advantages in his life? <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 2. Don goes through a number of spectacularly bad dates. What have been some of your own dating nightmares? <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 3. Where do you fall on the spectrum between structure and chaos in life? Are you highly rigid in your routines or very relaxed? <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 4. Do you agree with Don&#8217;s assessment that &#8220;humans often fail to see what is close to them and obvious to others&#8221;? (p. 88) <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 5. What do you think of Gene and Claudia&#8217;s relationship? Do you know anyone in an open marriage? Can it work? <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 6. Don says that the happiest day of his life was spent at the Museum of Natural History. Do you have a happiest day of your life? Or is there a special place where you are happiest? <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 7. As Don&#8217;s affection for Rosie grows, he becomes aware of his instincts overriding reason. What is the role of instinct versus reason when it comes to choosing a life partner? <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 8. Do you have anyone on the Autism spectrum in your life? <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 9. Don watches a number of movies to try to learn about romance, including <i>When Harry Met Sally, The Bridges of Madison County, An Affair to Remember,</i> and <i>Hitch. </i>What are your top five romantic movies? <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 10. Have you ever had a moment of breaking out of your routine and opening up in a significant way? Or has someone broken through your routine for you? <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 11. Is it smart to have a list of criteria for a potential partner or is it limiting? <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 12. Don gets in trouble with the dean for using the genetics lab for his personal project with Rosie. Is it ever okay to break the rules in order to help someone? <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 13. Do you feel happy for Don when he &#8220;eliminates a number of unconventional mannerisms&#8221; (p. 268) in order to win Rosie, or has he lost something? <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 14. Does Gene get his comeuppance? <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 15. Were you surprised at the ultimate revelation of Rosie&#8217;s biological father? Did you suspect someone else? <BR><BR><b>Enhance Your Book Club</b><BR><BR> 1. Make your own questionnaire for a potential mate. List ten questions and rank them in order of importance. <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 2. Look at the website for Autism Speaks. Get involved! Plan a walk or join another event: http://www.autismspeaks.org/events <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 3. Cook Don&#8217;s balcony meal: lobster, mango and avocado salad, wasabi-coated flying fish roe and crispy seaweed, and deep fried leek garnish. <BR>&nbsp;<BR> Don&#8217;s actual recipe is from <i>Contemporary Australian Cooking </i>by Teague Ezard (Hardie Grant) <BR>&nbsp;<BR> Lobster: http://allrecipes.com/HowTo/Fresh-Lobster/Detail.aspx <BR>&nbsp;<BR> Mango and avocado salad: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/sunny-anderson/mango-and-avocado-salad-recipe/index.html <BR>&nbsp;<BR> Leeks: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/leek-rings-recipe/index.html <BR>&nbsp;<BR> Flying fish roe: http://www.thekitchn.com/ingredient-spotlight-tobiko-fl-108067 <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 4. Take a ballroom dancing class so you can be as good as Bianca. <BR>&nbsp;<BR> 5. Take the Aspie quiz: http://rdos.net/eng/Aspie-quiz.php &nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR><b>A Conversation with Graeme Simsion&nbsp; </b><BR><BR><b> 1. Do you have experience with Autistic people? &nbsp;</b><BR><BR> I did a physics degree, worked for thirty years in information technology and taught at several universities. In these areas, technical skills are given more weight than social skills. So I met many people who I&#8217;m sure would have been diagnosed as being on the high-functioning end of the autism spectrum&#8211;had that diagnosis been common when they were younger. And I know a number of people with kids who have been diagnosed with Asperger&#8217;s /Austism. </b><BR><BR><b> 2. What or who was your inspiration for Don? &nbsp;</b><BR><BR> People I worked with and taught. There are plenty of Dons out there. One close friend struggled for many years to find a partner, and he provided inspiration for my first version of the story but the character and story have changed a lot since then. There is no &#8216;real Don&#8217;! </b><BR><BR><b> 3. Do you love the Museum of Natural History as much as Don does? &nbsp;</b><BR><BR> Not <i>that </i>much! But it&#8217;s one of my favorite places in New York. </b><BR><BR><b> 4. Do you have any idiosyncratic &#8220;deal breakers&#8221; like Don with ice cream preference? &nbsp;</b><BR><BR> I don&#8217;t think so, but I&#8217;ve been married for 24 years, so I don&#8217;t have a lot of recent dating experience (!) I really don&#8217;t like smoking, but dated a smoker for some time when I was younger. Back in those days, if I was really attracted to someone, I&#8217;d make a lot of concessions. Perhaps less so now. </b><BR><BR><b> 5. What&#8217;s your BMI? &nbsp;</b><BR><BR> 22.5. I ran a marathon in 2010 and it was quite a bit less then&#8211;and even less after I ended up in hospital for a week. The story is at http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/books/three-encounters-with-the-physical-20130111-2cl32.html </b><BR><BR><b> 6. Don is a bit of a foodie. You founded Pinot Now and have eaten at El Bulli. Can you talk about the role of food and wine in your life? &nbsp;</b><BR><BR> I&#8217;m also a bit of a foodie and a wine lover. I cook a lot, and put quite a bit of effort into meals. I actually do jog to the local market, though not on a regular a schedule as Don. &nbsp;</b><BR><BR> Cooking is a good opportunity for thinking (as it is for Don), and I enjoy the results. My wife and I drink a lot of wine &#8211; probably too much &#8211; and treat our travel as an opportunity to try restaurants and local produce. It&#8217;s a balance to the more intellectual business of writing. </b><BR><BR><b> 7. How did you develop and dive into Don&#8217;s voice? &nbsp;</b><BR><BR> I channeled a close friend who has a background in information technology&#8211;a very technical background. In the early drafts I could hear his voice, but over time Don developed his own mannerisms. I borrowed habits like &#8220;greetings&#8221; and expressions like &#8220;human sponge mode&#8221; from other colleagues and friends. </b><BR><BR><b> 8. Do you feel that this is a story of triumph for Don? &nbsp;</b><BR><BR> Absolutely. Don is the hero of the story in all senses. He sets out to do something that is a huge stretch and overcomes obstacles and his own limitations to achieve it &#8211; along the way learning some lessons about what he really needs. And he does this in a fundamentally decent way. </b><BR><BR><b> 9. You have a background in data modeling. What is that exactly, and did your experience with it contribute to your portrait of Don and his Wife Project? &nbsp;</b><BR><BR> It&#8217;s basically the job of specifying a database&#8211;describing in precise technical language what data is to be held and how it is to be represented. A bit like an architect describing to a builder exactly what needs to be built, after helping the client express their requirements and proposing a design. The discipline itself doesn&#8217;t feature in the book, but some of the people I met in the field&#8211;precise, highly organized people&#8211;contributed to my characterization of Don. </b><BR><BR><b> 10. You also write, produce, and act in films. How is the process of writing for film different from writing a novel? &nbsp;</b><BR><BR> Well, the acting was only one time! But I&#8217;ve produced numerous short films, and in fact wrote <i>The Rosie Project</i> as a screenplay before &#8220;sideways adapting&#8221; it into a novel. In screenwriting, at least for mainstream films, there is a strong emphasis on <i>story</i>&#8211;and story structure. It&#8217;s more formulaic than a novel, but it&#8217;s also a good discipline. In a romantic comedy you only have about 100 minutes, so you have to make every scene count. You see it in Rosie: it&#8217;s structured as a romantic comedy, and reads as a series of scenes. And it moves along pretty quickly. In a novel, you have the opportunity to describe the character&#8217;s thought processes &#8211; and in The Rosie Project that&#8217;s an important tool for comedy. On the screen you can use physical action and timing &#8211; which are not directly available to you on the page. </b><BR><BR><b> 11. You own a Porsche, have solo-flown a Cessna, and walked the Camino de Santiago. Is adventure something you seek out in life? &nbsp;</b><BR><BR> I&#8217;m not a physical thrill-seeker, but I enjoy challenges and achievement, and am very conscious that we only get one life. My wife drives the Porsche&#8211;most of the time I take the tram.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[A Reading Group Guide to </br> </br> <b><i>Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe </b></i></br> by Benjamin Alire S&#225;enz</br> </br> <b><u>About the Book</b></u></br> </br> When Aristotle, a loner, meets Dante at the swimming pool, the two strike up an unparalleled relationship. Dante is everything Aristotle wishes he were: articulate, smart, and self-confident. Together they begin questioning the secrets of the universe and navigating the painful journey from adolescence into adulthood. Sharing books, dreams, a near-fatal accident, and a year apart, the two discover the power of their friendship and develop an inseparable bond. </br> </br> <b><u>Prereading Questions</b></u></br> </br> 1. Do people always have to understand the people they love? Why or why not? </br> </br> 2. What characteristics are most admirable in a close friend? </br> </br> <b><u>Questions for Discussion</b></u></br> </br> 1. Aristotle (Ari) Mendoza is one of four children. His two older sisters and his older brother no longer live at home. Describe his relationship with his siblings. Why does he feel like the family mascot? </br> </br> 2. How does Ari meet Dante? Compare and contrast their personalities. </br> </br> 3. Why do Ari and Dante become friends? What personality traits does Ari most admire in Dante and why? </br> </br> 4. Does Ari have a close relationship with his parents? How does his relationship with his mother differ from his relationship with his father? </br> </br> 5. Where is Ari&#8217;s older brother Bernardo, and how is the family impacted by Bernardo&#8217;s absence? </br> </br> 6. Why is Ari&#8217;s father distant and how does he manage to deal with his emotional state? How does his wife justify his emotional distance? </br> </br> 7. How does Ari save Dante&#8217;s life and at what personal cost? Why does Ari feel angry after the accident? How does Ari&#8217;s relationship with his parents change after the accident? </br> </br> 8. Tragedy sometimes sets the stage for families to discuss topics that are long overdue. In what way does the accident help Ari better understand his parents? How does it help his parents come to know him better? </br> </br> 9. Why does Ari feel angry after the accident? By what rules does he insist that he and Dante play in regards to the accident? Why does he insist on these rules? </br> </br> 10. Dante is an artist and shares his sketchbook with Ari shortly after the accident. Why does Ari not look at the drawings? Why does he eventually do so? </br> </br> 11. Why do Ari&#8217;s parents buy him a pickup? Would they have done so prior to the accident? Why or why not? </br> </br> 12. How does Ari feel about Dante&#8217;s family moving to Chicago for one school year? How do the two stay connected during this time? </br> </br> 13. During their year apart, how do both Ari and Dante grow? Explain. </br> </br> 14. Who are Gina Naverro and Susie Byrd? How does Ari develop a friendship with them? </br> </br> 15. Ari becomes obsessed with kissing a classmate named Ileana. What role does Ileana play in the story? Is Ari in love with her? </br> </br> 16. Ari&#8217;s and Dante&#8217;s parents become good friends. Are they good parents? Support your response with evidence from the text. </br> </br> 17. In what way is a sparrow a symbol in the story? </br> </br> 18. Is Ari a responsible teen? Support your response with examples. </br> </br> 19. Ari is curious about his brother; however, he refuses to open an envelope that contains information about his brother that he finds tucked away in a drawer. Why does he not open the folder? </br> </br> 20. Ari&#8217;s mother leaves for a few days to care for an ailing aunt. How does his aunt&#8217;s death impact Ari&#8217;s parents? What does Ari learn about her, and his own family, after her death? How does this information impact him? </br> </br> 21. When Dante is beaten up for kissing a boy, Ari seeks revenge on Dante&#8217;s tormenters. Why does his revenge scare his parents? Is their fear justified? Why or why not? </br> </br> 22. How does Ari resolve his feelings for Dante? How does he resolve his feelings about his own self worth? </br> </br> <b><u>Questions for Further Discussion</b></u></br> </br> 1. In the beginning of the story, Ari doesn&#8217;t understand his father. He describes him as a &#8220;mystery.&#8221; As Ari matures he says, &#8220;I came to understand that my father was a careful man.&#8221; Explain Ari&#8217;s acceptance and understanding of his father. </br> </br> 2. Dante is a well-developed, unique character. What characteristics and behaviors does the author give Dante that contribute to this uniqueness? </br> </br> 3. Both Ari and Dante have distinctive voices. How does the author use dialogue to develop character voice? Cite examples. </br> </br> 4. At Dante&#8217;s suggestion, Ari reads Conrad&#8217;s <i>Heart of Darkness </i>and agrees with Conrad that the world is a dark place. Why does Ari have this viewpoint? Does this belief alter by story&#8217;s end? </br> </br> 5. The author uses a storm as a metaphor for pain. He writes, &#8220;Sometimes pain was like a storm that came out of nowhere. The clearest summer morning could end in a downpour. Could end in lightning and thunder.&#8221; How is this a fitting metaphor for Ari&#8217;s life? For his father&#8217;s? </br> </br> 6. Both Ari and his father have dreams in the story. Describe their dreams. What do the dreams mean to each of them? </br> </br> 7. Ari is depicted throughout the story as being lonely. What factors account for his loneliness and confusion? What role do his parents play in helping him accept his identity? </br> </br> 8. The novel is written from Ari&#8217;s point of view. How might the story be different were it written from Dante&#8217;s perspective? </br> </br> 9. Both Ari and Dante are intelligent teens. How does the author use vocabulary to convey this characteristic? Cite examples. </br> </br> 10. Ari feels self-contempt in the beginning of the story. What accounts for this feeling and how does it change as the story progresses? </br> </br> </br> <i>Guide written by Pam B.

      <d104><![CDATA[The Devil's Heart is a legendary object of unsurpassed power and mystery. Worlds that believe in magic consider it Darkness's mightiest talisman; and worlds of science consider it a lost artifact of some ancient and forgotten race. Some say the Heart enables its possessor to control people's minds and to amass wealth enough for a dozen lifetimes, while others think it capable of raising the dead, perhaps even changing the flow of time itself. But to all, the location of this fabled object has remained a mystery, until now. <BR>An isolated archaeological outpost has suddenly stopped responding to repeated requests for information. Sent to discover why, the <i>U.S.S. Enterprise</i>TM crew finds a devastated outpost and a dying scientist, whose last words fall on disbelieving ears: the Devil's Heart has been found. As the quest for the Heart unfolds, Captain Jean-Luc Picard discovers that beyond all the legends and age-old secrets lies an awful truth: whoever holds the Devil's Heart possesses power beyond imagining.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<i>Star Trek: The Next Generation </i>(TNG) focuses on the twenty-fourth century adventures of Captain Jean-Luc Picard aboard the USS&nbsp;<i>Enterprise</i> (NCC-1701-D).&nbsp;This incarnation of the famous starship is much larger than the one captained by James T. Kirk a century earlier, and, accordingly, it carries a larger crew complement: 1,012 men, women&hellip;and, surprisingly, children.&nbsp;This era&rsquo;s Starfleet Command believes that men and women are more likely to sign up for long-term exploratory missions if they think of their ship as home.&nbsp;Thus, Picard&rsquo;s crew enjoys many of the comforts they&rsquo;d have otherwise left behind, including a wide variety of recreational opportunities, &ldquo;replicated&rdquo; food dishes to suit every palate, and quarters large enough to share with spouses and offspring. There are schools for the children and a bar (stocked with synthetic alcohol, or synthehol) where the adults can unwind.&nbsp;However, the ongoing mission&mdash;no longer limited to a mere five years&mdash;remains virtually the same as it was during Kirk&rsquo;s time: to seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no one has gone before.]]></d104>

He shows how Siren Servers, which exploit big data and the free sharing of information, led our economy into recession, imperiled personal privacy, and hollowed out the middle class. The networks that define our world&#8212;including social media, financial institutions, and intelligence agencies&#8212;now threaten to destroy it.<BR> <BR>But there is an alternative. In this provocative, poetic, and deeply humane book, Lanier charts a path toward a brighter future: an information economy that rewards ordinary people for what they do and share on the web.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>The discovery of Christopher&rsquo;s diary in the ruins of Foxworth Hall brings new secrets of the Dollanganger family to light in this riveting novel from V.C. Andrews, the author of <i>Flowers in the Attic</i> and <i>Petals on the Wind</i>, both major Lifetime TV events.</b><BR><BR>Christopher Dollanganger was fourteen when he and his younger siblings&#8212;Cathy and the twins, Cory and Carrie&#8212;were locked away in the attic of Foxworth Hall, prisoners of their mother&rsquo;s greedy inheritance scheme. For three long years he kept hope alive for the sake of the others. But the shocking truth about how their ordeal affected him was always kept hidden&#8212;until now.<BR> <BR> Seventeen-year-old Kristin Masterwood is thrilled when her father&rsquo;s construction company is hired to inspect the Foxworth property for a prospective buyer. The once grand Southern mansion still sparks legends and half-truths about the four innocent Dollanganger children, even all these decades later. Foxworth holds a special fascination for Kristin, who was too young when her mother died to learn much about her distant blood tie to the notorious family.<BR> <BR> Accompanying her dad to the &ldquo;forbidden territory,&rdquo; they find a leather-bound book, its yellowed pages filled with the neat script of Christopher Dollanganger himself. Her father grows increasingly uneasy about her reading it, but as she devours the teen&rsquo;s story page by page, his shattering account of temptation, heartache, courage, and betrayal overtakes Kristin&rsquo;s every thought. And soon her obsession with the doomed boy crosses a dangerous line&hellip;]]></d104>

Draper presents &ldquo;storytelling at its finest&rdquo; (<i>School Library Journal</i>, starred review) in this <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Depression-era novel about a young girl who must learn to be brave in the face of violent prejudice when the Ku Klux Klan reappears in her segregated southern town.</b><BR><BR>Stella lives in the segregated South&#8212;in Bumblebee, North Carolina, to be exact about it. Some stores she can go into. Some stores she can&rsquo;t. Some folks are right pleasant. Others are a lot less so. To Stella, it sort of evens out, and heck, the Klan hasn&rsquo;t bothered them for years. But one late night, later than she should ever be up, much less wandering around outside, Stella and her little brother see something they&rsquo;re never supposed to see, something that is the first flicker of change to come, unwelcome change by any stretch of the imagination. As Stella&rsquo;s community&#8212;her world&#8212;is upended, she decides to fight fire with fire. And she learns that ashes don&rsquo;t necessarily signify an end.]]></d104>

Tensions run high and tempers flare as the two can hardly stand to be in the same room together.

And he wants to be the one to test this theory.<BR> <BR>Will Bridgette find it in herself to warm her heart to Warren and finally learn to love?<BR> <BR>Maybe.<BR> <BR><i>Maybe not. </i>]]></d104>

But when Georgia arrives home, nothing is at all familiar. Her parents, her brothers, the family business, are all unrecognizable. It seems her fianc&#233; isn&#8217;t the only one who&#8217;s been keeping secrets&#8230;<BR> <BR><i>Eight Hundred Grapes</i> is a story about the messy realities of family, the strength (and weaknesses) of romantic love, and the importance of finding a place to call home. &#8220;This winning tale will both satisfy on a literary level and encourage oenophiles to pour themselves a glass of a recent vintage to enjoy while reading; it&#8217;s a tasty treat for wine lovers and teetotalers alike&#8221; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>).

We hope that these ideas will enrich your conversation and increase your enjoyment of the book. </I><BR> <BR> &nbsp;<BR> <BR> <B>Introduction </B><BR> <BR> In law school, Georgia Ford made her twin brothers sign a pact to never take over their family&rsquo;s vineyard. There was no way she was going to get stuck in the tiny Californian town she had known all her life. Years later, Georgia&rsquo;s life seems to be on track. She&rsquo;s a successful lawyer engaged to a handsome British man who is ready to whisk her away to a chic new life in London.<BR> <BR> But just a week before her dream wedding, Georgia discovers that her supposedly perfect fianc&eacute; has been hiding a life-changing secret: a four-year-old daughter that he unwittingly conceived with a beautiful movie star. Devastated, she flees north to the one place she was determined never to use as a safety net. Upon her return home, however, Georgia realizes that her fianc&eacute; is not the only one with secrets. The family business is crumbling, and it&rsquo;s up to her to save the vineyard from its last harvest.<BR> <BR> <I>Eight Hundred Grapes</I> is an astonishing portrait of an American family seeking solace where they least expect it, and their desperate attempt to find solid ground.<BR> <BR> &nbsp;<BR> <BR> <B>Questions and Topics for Discussion </B><BR> <BR> 1. Discuss the myth of the yellow VW bug and the Ford family&rsquo;s belief in &ldquo;synchronization&rdquo; as opposed to fate. How does this theory evolve over the course of the novel?<BR> <BR> 2. Do you think Georgia feels she has agency in the beginning of the story? The end? Is she right?<BR> <BR> 3. Georgia has made a lot of life choices to avoid repeating an upbringing that involved unpredictability. How does your life resist or yield to your own childhood? Discuss how that relates to the definition of &ldquo;concerto&rdquo; and its varying degrees of cooperation and opposition.<BR> <BR> 4. As twins, Finn and Bobby are often at odds with each other. In what ways do you think they are alike? Why do you think it&rsquo;s so difficult for them to connect?<BR> <BR> 5. The one common denominator for the Ford siblings is love of their mother&rsquo;s lasagna. Do you have a similar tradition in your family? What brings you together, no matter what?<BR> <BR> 6. Discuss the role of the contract that Georgia asks her brothers to sign. Why is she so afraid of the vineyard? Can you relate?<BR> <BR> 7. How does forgiveness play into this story? Could you forgive Ben for hiding Maddie? Could you forgive Finn for kissing Margaret?<BR> <BR> 8. Georgia insists on doing everything in her power to stop her loved ones from doing something they&rsquo;ll regret. Discuss her mother&rsquo;s response, &ldquo;But which way is regret?&rdquo; What do you think she means here?<BR> <BR> 9. Why is Jacob unexpectedly appealing to Georgia? Discuss their similarities, both in personality and life paths.<BR> <BR> 10. Georgia&rsquo;s father has many rules of winemaking, like: &ldquo;If you do your job,&rdquo; then, &ldquo;you make good soil.&rdquo; He also has &ldquo;a theory that what was equally as important as the wine you presented in your vintage was the wine you left out of the vintage.&nbsp;In winemaking, this was known as declassification.&rdquo;&nbsp;How do these rules apply to decision making on a larger scale? Do you think Georgia abides by them?<BR> <BR> 11. Who are Georgia&rsquo;s &ldquo;have-to-haves&rdquo; at the end of the novel? Who are the have-to-haves in your own life?<BR> <BR> 12. Ben takes full responsibility for lying, but Finn points out that Georgia wasn&rsquo;t necessarily tuned in to her fianc&eacute;. Discuss whether there are two sides to every conflict, even when something seems black and white.<BR> <BR> 13. Do you think that Georgia will be happy running the vineyard and being with Jacob? Why or why not? What&rsquo;s the biggest lesson she has learned?<BR> <BR> &nbsp;<BR> <BR> <B>Tips to Enhance Your Book Club</B><BR> <BR> 1. This is the perfect excuse to make a wine tasting part of your book club! Research local vineyards and be adventurous about trying vintages outside your comfort zone.<BR> <BR> 2. According to the Ford family, both music and wine rely on synchronization. Patronize a concert together, whether it&rsquo;s a symphony or something simpler.<BR> <BR> 3. Check out Laura Dave&rsquo;s other incredible novels, <I>The First Husband</I>, <I>The Divorce Party</I>, and <I>London is the Best City in America</I>. Discuss which is your favorite and why.<BR> <BR> 4. Laura Dave has created a special wine pairings&ndash;guide for book clubs: (http://sns-production-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/assets_us/winepairingsforbookclubs.pdf). Use her guide to make your book club meetings extra special!<BR> <BR> &nbsp;<BR> <BR> <B>A Conversation with Laura Dave</B><BR> <BR> <B>I have to ask, did you have a particular celebrity in mind when you wrote Michelle? How did you research her character?</B><BR> <BR> Funny. No, Michelle is entirely her own. Michelle serves, in my mind, as kind of a glorified version of Georgia&rsquo;s insecurity: a person that looms large in Georgia&rsquo;s imagination and always manages to make her feel inadequate. That&rsquo;s why I have Michelle show up at the moments that Georgia looks terrible. Symbolically, if not literally, Michelle is going to elicit that feeling for Georgia until she deals with herself.<BR> <BR> Separate from Georgia, I have great fondness for Michelle. She is searching for family, for connection. And even if she&rsquo;s arguably doing it the wrong way, I like that we see her kindness with Maddie, her kindness with Ben. I like to think she holds on to her family despite herself.<BR> <BR> <B>Speaking of research, you spent a lot of time in Sebastapol&mdash;home of the Last Straw Vineyard. Tell us what that experience was like. What surprised you about the winemaking process?</B><BR> <BR> Western Sonoma County is such a special place. I started exploring Sebastopol in particular shortly after moving to California, and the more time I spend there, the more it&rsquo;s become a place I hold dear. There are a lot of changes in Sebastopol, and yet, it remains true to itself.<BR> <BR> To really understand that region though, you have to get down and dirty with the winemaking&mdash;and that has been the greatest treat of all. I was fortunate to spend time with some of the best winemakers in the world, and watching their devotion to their craft was so inspiring.<BR> <BR> To answer your question about the most surprising part of the winemaking process? The barreling and blending process was especially interesting. My husband equated it to watching a master chef make a stew. It was fascinating.<BR> <BR> <B>Do you have a favorite wine? What is your go to? What do you drink on special occasions?</B><BR> <BR> I like prosecco a lot. Even if you&rsquo;re a champagne drinker, I could share a few types of dry prosecco that would turn your head. And even the great ones won&rsquo;t run you more than fourteen dollars.&nbsp;<BR> <BR> My true love though is a red wine. I&rsquo;ve been indoctrinated. I love a Tuscan red.&nbsp; My passion though is for premium domestic wines from small vineyards that believe in low-yields and sustainable harvesting. I&rsquo;m especially partial to a great California Pinot Noir. Lynmar Estate&rsquo;s Quail Hill Pinot is among my favorites. It&rsquo;s jammy and delicious. Their vineyard is my first stop in Sonoma County.<BR> <BR> <B>Tell us about your writing process for this book. Did it differ at all from your three previous novels?</B><BR> <BR> Every novel is so different. For <I>Eight Hundred Grapes</I>, I was playing with an image for a long time of a woman showing up at her hometown bar on what should have been her wedding day. I didn&rsquo;t know who she was talking to, and I didn&rsquo;t know why she had come home, but that woman stayed with me. Somewhere along the line, I also started thinking about winemaking&mdash;how it was such an expression of faith and patience.&nbsp; How it required you to give it everything you had. Which seemed to me a metaphor for marriage and family and building a life that matters. Suddenly I knew where the woman in the wedding dress was going. And this novel was born.<BR> <BR> <B>You have vast experience in the media industry, from magazine writing to radio to television. What has been the greatest challenge for you thus far?</B><BR> <BR> I don&rsquo;t know about that, but it&rsquo;s been interesting to learn how different mediums require different ways of thinking about story. I&rsquo;m currently writing the screenplay for <I>Eight Hundred Grapes</I> (which is in development at Fox 2000), and even though it&rsquo;s based on the novel, it has taken on a different life as we turn it into a movie. It&rsquo;s challenging in a great way to tell the Fords&rsquo; story on the big screen.<BR> <BR> <B>Which character surprised you the most as you developed the story? Who would you most like to return to?</B><BR> <BR> I don&rsquo;t write an outline, so everyone is constantly surprising me! I figure if the characters are surprising me then my readers are going to get to have that same great experience. I have a real affinity for Jacob, who was full of surprises. I knew he felt things for Georgia, but I had no idea what he was going to do about those feelings: How would he reconcile his desire to be a good person with his new position at his company? He couldn&rsquo;t possibly give Georgia back her vineyard, could he? Yet, could he walk away from this family he was starting to care about?&nbsp; At the moment when I realized what he was going to do, I found it very rewarding.<BR> <BR> As for the character that I&rsquo;d most like to return to, I have to pick Ben.<BR> <BR> <B>Do you have a big family? Which Ford sibling do you most relate to&mdash;Georgia, Finn, or Bobby?</B><BR> <BR> I have a small and very loving family. Though I&rsquo;ve always dreamed of a big family&mdash;lots of people running around causing all kinds of trouble. So, with the Ford family, I relate to all of them and, at times, none of them.<BR> <BR> I adore the Ford family, but they all feel like wildcards. Especially as I moved deeper into the writing, the Fords were doing things I wouldn&rsquo;t normally do, and I felt myself holding my breath that each of them would find their way through. My heart breaks for all of them, and I&rsquo;m rooting for all of them. So I guess, surprisingly, I most see myself in Jen Ford, the mother character, who just wants her children to come through for one another and for themselves. &nbsp;<BR> <BR> <B>What&rsquo;s up next? Do you have another novel in the works? What can you tell us about it?</B><BR> <BR> It&rsquo;s a lot of fun. The protagonist is unlike any protagonist I&rsquo;ve ever written about before.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a pretty awful person&mdash;at least she appears to be upon meeting her. At the same time, she would be the first to say that about herself, which automatically makes you root for her, probably more than you should. Without spilling too many of the beans, I will say it&rsquo;s a redemption story about the power of lying and the power of finding something like the truth.]]></d104>

Andrews, bestselling author of <i>Flowers in the Attic</i> (the first in a series of Lifetime movie events about the Dollanganger family), comes the tale of a gifted teenager who finds that mastering high school is much easier than mastering her heart.</b><BR><BR>Mayfair Cummings is young, beautiful, and brilliant. But her intelligence makes her the outcast of both the private school she attends and the broken family she hopes to salvage. When she catches the eye of both a popular senior and her handsome English teacher, not even her brilliant mind can help her navigate the explosive new relationships she is forming, or a scandal that is brewing&#8230;]]></d104>

As Lily might say, &lsquo;YOU! MUST! READ! THIS!

The intimacy of pet ownership is sweetly suffused throughout this heartwarming autobiographical fiction... In generous helpings of bittersweet humanity, Rowley has written an immensely poignant and touchingly relatable tale that readers (particularly animal lovers) will love.&rdquo;<BR> <b>&mdash;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><BR> <BR> &ldquo;Steven Rowley&rsquo;s touching, fresh, energetic novel isn&rsquo;t simply another &lsquo;boy and his dog&rsquo; story. It is a profound exploration of grief&mdash;how we find ourselves lost, how we search for reason, how we sacrifice ourselves for our loved ones, all to avoid paying the octopus. But the octopus will be paid. And in settling that debt, in the magical, hopeful world of&nbsp;<i>Lily and the Octopus</i>, we will learn to live&mdash;and love&mdash;again. A wonderfully moving story.&rdquo;<BR> <b>&mdash;Garth Stein, bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Art of Racing in the Rain</i></b><BR> <BR> &ldquo;An exceedingly authentic, keenly insightful, and heartbreakingly poignant tribute to the purity of love between a pet and its human.&rdquo;<BR> <b>&mdash;</b><b><i>Booklist</i>&nbsp;(starred review)</b><BR> <BR> &ldquo;A quirky and deeply affecting charmer of a novel,&nbsp;<i>Lily and the Octopus</i>&nbsp;is funny, wise, and utterly original in its exploration of what it means to love any mortal creature.

A fast and funny read that also happens to be a profound meditation on love and forgiveness,&nbsp;<i>Lily and the Octopus&nbsp;</i>is a delight.&rdquo;<BR> <b>&mdash;Christina Baker Kline, bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>Orphan Train</i></b><BR> <BR> &ldquo;Intelligently written, finely observed, and surprisingly moving, this is a book you&rsquo;ll find hard to put down.&rdquo;<BR> <b>&mdash;Graeme Simsion, bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Rosie Project</i></b><BR> <BR> &ldquo;A whimsical, touching tale&rdquo;<BR> <b>&mdash;<i>People</i></b><BR> <BR> &ldquo;My favorite book of the year: Steven Rowley&#39;s&nbsp;<i>Lily and the Octopus</i>. Hilarious, heartbreaking. You will absolutely cry and you will love it.&quot;&nbsp;<BR> <b>&mdash;Patrick Ness, bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Rest of Us Just Live Here</i></b><BR> <BR> &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to be a dog lover to enjoy Steven Rowley&rsquo;s new book, &lsquo;Lily and the Octopus,&rsquo; but if you&rsquo;ve realized you like your dog more than most humans you encounter, this is one you won&rsquo;t want to miss.&rdquo;<BR> &mdash;<b>Newport Beach Independent</b><BR> <BR> &ldquo;In his funny, ardent and staunchly kooky way, Rowley expresses exactly what it&#39;s like to love a dog.&rdquo;<BR> <b>&mdash;</b><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><BR> <BR> &ldquo;Rowley shares a moving, profound tale of grappling with loss.&rdquo;<BR> <b>&mdash;Real Simple</b><BR> <BR> &ldquo;It is a joyful book; it is also a sincerely written tragedy that invoked the purity of friendship between animal/human family members. It&#39;s laughter through tears. Rowley has a sense of humor with just enough morbid sensibility to appeal to a wide audience (even if animal best friend books aren&#39;t one&#39;s thing). Yet, he navigates the five stages of grief and loss while inspiring others to appreciate the lives we already have.&rdquo;<BR> <b>&mdash;Edge Media</b><BR> <BR> &ldquo;Portland&rsquo;s Steven Rowley strikes a chord in a moving book about heartache and friendship that is expected to be a big seller this summer.&rdquo;<BR> <b>&mdash;<i>Portland Press Herald</i></b><BR> <BR> &ldquo;The connection between man and dog is loud and clear in this sweet novel&hellip;&rdquo;<BR> <b>&mdash;Fort Worth Star-Telegram</b><BR> <BR> &ldquo;Author Steven Rowley uses humor and pop-culture references to tell a whimsical story of courage in the face of heartbreaking reality. Philosophical and introspective, &ldquo;Lily and the Octopus&rdquo; also looks at the transformative power of love, the importance of forgiveness and the beauty of really living, letting ourselves be seen instead of hiding in plain sight&hellip;I laughed, I sobbed, and at the end, I felt as if I&rsquo;d caught up with a friend over coffee.&rdquo;<BR> <b>&mdash;The Free Lance-Star</b>]]></d104>

But underneath that surface lies a world shifting under high school junior Aaron Holland Broussard&rsquo;s feet. The underlying class war between the <i>haves</i> and <i>have nots</i> is growing steadily, along with the menace of conflict overseas in Korea, providing a harrowing backdrop to his growth to manhood. But when Aaron spots the beautiful Valerie Epstein at a drive-in, he steps in when he sees her fighting with her boyfriend, Grady Harrelson. Aaron&rsquo;s newfound confidence helps catch Valerie&rsquo;s eye, and the two begin dating. Grady is a live wire though, and presents a looming problem for Aaron.<BR> <BR> You will recall the feelings and inspirational power of your first love, and empathize with Aaron&rsquo;s extraordinary challenges to protect himself and the ones he loves in &ldquo;this dark, atmospheric story&rdquo; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>). <i>The Jealous Kind</i> illustrates how first loves, friendship, violence, and power can alter what traditional America means for the people trying to find their way in a changing world.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>In this &ldquo;brave and heartbreaking novel that digs its claws into you and doesn&rsquo;t let go, long after you&rsquo;ve finished it&rdquo; (Anna Todd, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author) from the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>All Your Perfects</i>, a workaholic with a too-good-to-be-true romance can&rsquo;t stop thinking about her first love. </b><BR><BR>Lily hasn&rsquo;t always had it easy, but that&rsquo;s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She&rsquo;s come a long way from the small town where she grew up&#8212;she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily&rsquo;s life seems too good to be true.<BR> <BR>Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He&rsquo;s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn&rsquo;t hurt. Lily can&rsquo;t get him out of her head. But Ryle&rsquo;s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his &ldquo;no dating&rdquo; rule, she can&rsquo;t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.<BR> <BR>As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan&#8212;her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.<BR> <BR>An honest, evocative, and tender novel, <i>It Ends with Us</i> is &ldquo;a glorious and touching read, a forever keeper. The kind of book that gets handed down&rdquo; (<i>USA TODAY</i>).]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>This instant <i>New York Times</i> bestseller&#8212;&ldquo;a jaw-dropping, fast-paced account&rdquo; (<i>New York Post</i>) recounts SEAL Team Operator Robert O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s incredible four-hundred-mission career, including the attempts to rescue &ldquo;Lone Survivor&rdquo; Marcus Luttrell and abducted-by-Somali-pirates Captain Richard Phillips, and which culminated in the death of the world&rsquo;s most wanted terrorist&#8212;Osama bin Laden.</b><BR><BR>In <i>The Operator</i>, Robert O&rsquo;Neill describes his idyllic childhood in Butte, Montana; his impulsive decision to join the SEALs; the arduous evaluation and training process; and the even tougher gauntlet he had to run to join the SEALs&rsquo; most elite unit. After officially becoming a SEAL, O&rsquo;Neill would spend more than a decade in the most intense counterterror effort in US history. For extended periods, not a night passed without him and his small team recording multiple enemy kills&#8212;and though he was lucky enough to survive, several of the SEALs he&rsquo;d trained with and fought beside never made it home.<BR> <BR>&ldquo;Impossible to put down&hellip;<i>The Operator</i> is unique, surprising, a kind of counternarrative, and certainly the other half of the story of one of the world&rsquo;s most famous military operations&hellip;In the larger sense, this book is about&hellip;how to be human while in the very same moment dealing with death, destruction, combat&rdquo; (Doug Stanton, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author). O&rsquo;Neill describes the nonstop action of his deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, evokes the black humor of years-long combat, brings to vivid life the lethal efficiency of the military&rsquo;s most selective units, and reveals details of the most celebrated terrorist takedown in history. This is &ldquo;a riveting, unvarnished, and wholly unforgettable portrait of America&rsquo;s most storied commandos at war&rdquo; (Joby Warrick).]]></d104>

The FBI tracked down Dora Fronczak, the kidnapped infant&rsquo;s mother, and she identified the abandoned boy as her son. The family spent the next fifty years believing they were whole again&#8212;but Paul was always unsure about his true identity.<BR> <BR>Then, four years ago&#8212;spurred on by the birth of his first child, Emma Faith&#8212;Paul took a DNA test. The test revealed that he was definitely <i>not</i> Paul Fronczak. From that moment on, Paul has been on a tireless mission to find the man whose life he&rsquo;s been living&#8212;and to discover who abandoned him, and why.<BR> <BR>Poignant and inspiring, <i>The Foundling</i> is a story about a child lost and a faith found, about the permanence of families and the bloodlines that define you, and about the emotional toll of both losing your identity and rediscovering who you truly are.]]></d104>

With a rare allergy to human touch, any skin-to-skin contact could literally kill her. But after retreating into solitude for nearly ten years, Jubilee&rsquo;s decided to brave the world again, despite the risks. Armed with a pair of gloves, long sleeves, and her trusty bicycle, she finally ventures out the front door&#8212;and into her future.<BR> <BR>Eric Keegan has troubles of his own. With his daughter from a failed marriage no longer speaking to him, and his brilliant, if psychologically troubled, adopted son attempting telekinesis, Eric&rsquo;s struggling to figure out how his life got so off course, and how to be the dad&#8212;and man&#8212;he wants to be. So when an encounter over the check-out desk at the local library entangles his life with that of a beautiful&#8212;albeit eccentric&#8212;woman, he finds himself wanting nothing more than to be near her.<BR> <BR>Charming and utterly unique, <i>Close Enough to Touch </i>is &ldquo;a story that overflows with compassion, humor, and the impulsive need to read just one more chapter until you reach the very satisfying end&rdquo; (Patti Callahan Henry, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author).]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>Now an HBO series starring Kathryn Hahn!</b><BR> <BR><b>&ldquo;Light, zingy, and laugh-out-loud funny&rdquo;</b><b> (<i>People</i>), the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling novel about sex, love, and identity as seen through the eyes of a middle-aged woman and her college freshman son.</b><BR><BR>A forty-six-year-old divorcee whose beloved only child has just left for college, Eve Fletcher is struggling to adjust to her empty nest. One night she receives a text from an anonymous number that says, &ldquo;<i>U R my MILF</i>!&rdquo; Over the months that follow, that message comes to obsess Eve. While leading her all-too-placid life&#8212;serving as Executive Director of the local senior center and taking a community college course on Gender and Society&#8212;Eve can&rsquo;t curtail her own interest in a porn website that features the erotic exploits of ordinary, middle-aged women like herself. Before long, Eve&rsquo;s online fixations begin to spill over into real life, revealing new romantic possibilities that threaten to upend her quiet suburban existence.<BR> <BR>Meanwhile, miles away at the state college, Eve&rsquo;s son Brendan&#8212;a jock and aspiring frat boy&#8212;discovers that his new campus isn&rsquo;t nearly as welcoming to his hard-partying lifestyle as he had imagined. Only a few weeks into his freshman year, Brendan is floundering in a college environment that challenges his white-dude privilege and shames him for his outmoded, chauvinistic ideas of sex. As the New England autumn turns cold, both mother and son find themselves enmeshed in morally fraught situations that come to a head on one fateful November night.<BR> <BR>&ldquo;The sweetest and most charming novel about pornography addiction and the harrowing issues of sexual consent that you will probably ever read&rdquo; (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>),<i> Mrs. Fletcher </i>is a timeless examination of sexuality, identity, parenthood, and the big clarifying mistakes people can make when they&rsquo;re no longer sure of who they are or where they belong. &ldquo;Tom Perrotta&rsquo;s latest might just be his best&rdquo; (NPR).]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>&ldquo;Wake presents an intense, suspenseful, and unusual tale of romantic suspense that will make readers question their perceptions of gender and relationships.&rdquo; &#8212;<i>Booklist</i> (starred review)</b><BR> <BR> <b>A &ldquo;fast-paced, mind-bending romantic thriller&rdquo; (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, starred review) about a transgender vlog star who struggles with a past that continues to haunt him as he sets out to prove that he&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;bad boy,&rdquo; but something else entirely: a good man.</b><BR><BR>Vlog star Renard Grant has nothing to prove: he&rsquo;s got a pretty face, chiseled body, and two million adoring video subscribers. Plus scars on his chest and a prescription for testosterone. Because Ren is transgender: assigned female at birth, living now as male. He films his transition and shares it bravely with the world; his fans love his honesty and positivity.<BR> <BR>But Ren has been living a double life.<BR> <BR>Off-camera, he&rsquo;s Cane, the muscle-bound enforcer for social justice vigilante group Black Iris. As Cane, he lets his dark side loose. Hurts those who prey on the disempowered. Indulges in the ugly side of masculinity. And his new partner, Tamsin Baylor, is a girl as rough and relentless as he is. Together, they terrorize the trolls into silence. But when a routine Black Iris job goes south, Ren is put in the crosshairs. Someone is out to ruin his life. He&rsquo;s a bad boy, they say, guilty of what he punishes others for. Just like every other guy: at heart, he&rsquo;s a monster, too.<BR> <BR>Now Ren&rsquo;s got everything to prove. He has to clear his name, and show the world he&rsquo;s a good man. But that requires facing demons he&rsquo;s locked away for years. And it might mean discovering he&rsquo;s not such a good guy after all.<BR> <BR>Elliot Wake has written a &ldquo;searingly modern game of cat and mouse&rdquo; (L.S. Hilton, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author) that &ldquo;compels readers to question their conceptions about gender and desire&rdquo; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>). Darkly humorous and evocatively sexy, <i>Bad Boy</i> is romantic suspense at its finest.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i></b><b> BESTSELLER</b><BR> <BR><b>From the author of <i>Daisy Jones & The Six</i>&#8212;an entrancing and &ldquo;wildly addictive journey of a reclusive Hollywood starlet&rdquo; (<i>PopSugar</i>) as she reflects on her relentless rise to the top and the risks she took, the loves she lost, and the long-held secrets the public could never imagine.</b><BR><BR>Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?<BR> <BR>Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left her, and her professional life is going nowhere. Regardless of why Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.<BR> <BR>Summoned to Evelyn&rsquo;s luxurious apartment, Monique listens in fascination as the actress tells her story. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the &lsquo;80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way, Evelyn unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love. Monique begins to feel a very real connection to the legendary star, but as Evelyn&rsquo;s story near its conclusion, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique&rsquo;s own in tragic and irreversible ways.<BR> <BR>&ldquo;Heartbreaking, yet beautiful&rdquo; (Jamie Blynn, <i>Us Weekly</i>), <i>The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo </i>is &ldquo;Tinseltown drama at its finest&rdquo; (<i>Redbook</i>): a mesmerizing journey through the splendor of old Hollywood into the harsh realities of the present day as two women struggle with what it means&#8212;and what it costs&#8212;to face the truth.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[&quot;This is a multi-voice recording, one so good it was a 2018 Audie award finalist. I loved it--the story, the narration, the whole thing. I really felt like I was sitting there, along with the character of Monique, listening to this aged actress (who reminded me of Liz Taylor) recount the highs and lows of her Hollywood life. I would listen to this one again, and that&#39;s saying something.&quot;]]></d104>

Outside is the world from which she has been severed: her young son, Jackson, and the San Francisco of her youth. Inside is a new reality: thousands of women hustling for the bare essentials needed to survive; the bluffing and pageantry and casual acts of violence by guards and prisoners alike; and the deadpan absurdities of institutional living, portrayed with great humor and precision.<BR> <BR> Stunning and unsentimental, <i>The Mars Room</i> is &ldquo;wholly authentic&hellip;profound&hellip;luminous&rdquo; (<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>),<b> </b> &ldquo;one of those books that enrage you even as they break your heart&rdquo; (<i>The New York Times Book Review, </i>cover review)&#8212;a spectacularly compelling, heart-stopping novel about a life gone off the rails in contemporary America. It is audacious and tragic, propulsive and yet beautifully refined and &ldquo;affirms Rachel Kushner as one of our best novelists&rdquo; (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>).]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>From a searing new literary voice, a raw, compulsively readable memoir about a young man seeking hope, community, and ultimately recovery from addiction in a series of halfway houses and boys&rsquo; homes&#8212;the first book to so vividly capture this world.</b><BR><BR>In his late teens Tom Macher rebelled against a world that seemed stacked against him. Raised in a broken family and estranged from an absentee father suffering with AIDS, Macher turned to alcohol to escape the painful loneliness of his reality.<BR> <BR> In quick succession, he is kicked out of school, and then his mother&rsquo;s house, sent to a boys&rsquo; home in Montana, and later, a halfway house in a truck-stop town of Louisiana. It was there that Macher encounters a community of young men struggling to survive&#8212;outcasts and thieves, liars and ex-cons, men seeking redemption, men running from the past. As he moves further away from boyhood and embraces a hard-won sobriety, these men&#8212;the broken, the hardscrabble, the near gone&#8212;become his salvation.<BR> <BR> Macher captures the trials of sobriety&#8212;suicide, death, recovery&#8212;and the unusual beauty that forms in the bonds of those who suffer. In visceral, striking prose, he introduces the unforgettable characters he meets along the way, from a former child actor, a young teen struggling with schizophrenia, a tough-love addiction counselor, a sex-addicted social worker, to Matt O, who became Macher&rsquo;s loyal friend and wingman. Raw, disarming, frenetic, and subversive,<i> Halfway</i> is a brutally honest portrait of the world of down-and-out recovering alcoholics, and a story of how, in their darkest hour, these men create the bonds that form a family.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>For fans of <i>Black Mirror </i>and <i>True Detective,</i> a visceral, high-concept thriller about a psychologist who must protect the life of an eleven-year-old girl whose ability to remember past lives makes them both targets of a ruthless assassin. </b><BR><BR>Dr. Matilda Deacon is a psychologist researching how memories are made and stored when she meets a strange eleven-year-old girl named Ashanique. The girl claims to harbor the memories of the last soldier killed in World War I and Matilda is skeptical. But when Ashanique starts talking about being chased by the Night Doctors&#8212;a term also used by an unstable patient who was later found dead&#8212;Matilda can&rsquo;t deny that the girl might be telling the truth.<BR> <BR>Matilda soon learns that Ashanique and her mother have been on the run their whole lives from a monstrous assassin named Rade. Rade is seeking a certain component ingrained solely in memories, and has left a bloody trail throughout the world. Matilda realizes that Ashanique is in unimaginable danger and that her unique ability comes with a deadly price.<BR> <BR>&ldquo;A taut, riveting thriller, a perfect balance of scientific speculation and storytelling&rdquo; (James Rollins, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author), <i>The Clarity </i>is a compelling take on the possibilities of reincarnation and life after death.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>In the third book of the Nebula Award&#8211;nominated Arcadia Project series, which <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Seanan McGuire called &ldquo;exciting, inventive, and brilliantly plotted,&rdquo; Millie Roper has to pull off two impossible heists&#8212;with the fate of the worlds in the balance.</b><BR><BR>Three months ago, a rift between agents in London and Los Angeles tore the Arcadia Project apart. With both fey Courts split down the middle&#8212;half supporting London, half LA&#8212;London is putting the pieces in place to quash the resistance. But due to an alarming backslide in her mental health, new LA agent Mille Roper is in no condition to fight.<BR> <BR>When London&rsquo;s opening shot is to frame Millie&rsquo;s partner, Tjuan, for attempted homicide, Millie has no choice but to hide him and try to clear his name. Her investigation will take her across the pond to the heart of Arcadia at the mysterious and impenetrable White Rose palace. The key to Tjuan&rsquo;s freedom&#8212;and to the success of the revolution&#8212;is locked in a vault under the fey Queen&rsquo;s watchful eye. It&rsquo;s up to Millie to plan and lead a heist that will shape the future of two worlds&#8212;all while pretending that she knows exactly what she&rsquo;s doing&hellip;]]></d104>

Finn, #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Woman in the Window</i></b><BR> <BR><b>The instant <i>New York Times</i> and #1<i> Sunday Times </i>bestselling author of the <i>Then She Was Gone</i> delivers another suspenseful page-turner about a shocking murder in a picturesque and well-to-do English town, perfect &ldquo;for fans of <i>Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train, </i>and <i>Luckiest Girl Alive&rdquo; </i>(<i>Library Journal).</i></b><BR><BR>Melville Heights is one of the nicest neighborhoods in Bristol, England; home to doctors and lawyers and old-money academics. It&rsquo;s not the sort of place where people are brutally murdered in their own kitchens. But it is the sort of place where everyone has a secret. And everyone is watching you.<BR> <BR> As the headmaster credited with turning around the local school, Tom Fitzwilliam is beloved by one and all&#8212;including Joey Mullen, his new neighbor, who quickly develops an intense infatuation with this thoroughly charming yet unavailable man. Joey thinks her crush is a secret, but Tom&rsquo;s teenaged son Freddie&#8212;a prodigy with aspirations of becoming a spy for MI5&#8212;excels in observing people and has witnessed Joey behaving strangely around his father.<BR> <BR> One of Tom&rsquo;s students, Jenna Tripp, also lives on the same street, and she&rsquo;s not convinced her teacher is as squeaky clean as he seems. For one thing, he has taken a particular liking to her best friend and fellow classmate, and Jenna&rsquo;s mother&#8212;whose mental health has admittedly been deteriorating in recent years&#8212;is convinced that Mr. Fitzwilliam is stalking her.<BR> <BR> Meanwhile, twenty years earlier, a schoolgirl writes in her diary, charting her doomed obsession with a handsome young English teacher named Mr. Fitzwilliam&hellip;<BR> <BR> In Lisa Jewell&rsquo;s latest brilliant &ldquo;bone-chilling suspense&rdquo; (<i>People</i>) no one is who they seem&#8212;and everyone is hiding something. Who has been murdered&#8212;and who would have wanted one of their neighbors dead? As &ldquo;Jewell teases out her twisty plot at just the right pace&rdquo; (<i>Booklist</i>, starred review), you will be kept guessing until the startling revelation on the very last page.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<i>This reading group guide for <b>Watching You </b>includes discussion questions and ideas for enhancing your book club. The suggested questions are intended to help your reading group find new and interesting angles and topics for your discussion. We hope that these ideas will enrich your conversation and increase your enjoyment of the book.</i><BR><BR> <b>Topics and Questions for Discussion</b><BR> <BR>1. <i>Watching You</i> begins with a diary excerpt from 1996. How does this passage set the tone for the novel? Now that you&rsquo;ve finished reading, who do you think wrote it?<BR><BR>2. Lisa Jewell includes a number of red herrings that lead the reader to one suspicion and then another. What were some of the red herrings you noticed in the book? Did you fall for them?<BR><BR>3. Early on, we see how Freddie thinks about his surveillance &ldquo;project&rdquo;: &ldquo;Freddie was not a voyeur. Voyeurism was a form of control. . . . He watched girls in order to understand them. He was just trying to work it all out&rdquo; (p. 38). Do you agree that his intent and motivation in spying is what&rsquo;s most important? And in our privacy-deprived world (where our information, photos, and even thoughts are often available online), what kind of watching is too much? How do we define an invasion of privacy?<BR><BR>4. Jenna Tripp describes the chat rooms her mother frequents as somewhere &ldquo;she could go to have her craziness validated&rdquo; (p. 130). Many people use online communities to form connections and feel less isolated, particularly if they feel misunderstood by those around them. Yet Jenna observes that her mother&rsquo;s delusions are being exacerbated by talking to people with similar issues. Discuss what makes an insular community (like a chat room) supportive or detrimental. Can it be both?<BR><BR>5. Freddie recollects that his parents taught him not to embrace the diagnosis his doctors had given him because he would &ldquo;always be so much more than a label&rdquo; (p. 234). Do you think claiming an identity label, like the one Freddie eventually reclaims, is limiting? Why, or why not?<BR><BR>6. On page 239, Freddie tells Jenna about how his mother accommodates all of his father&rsquo;s desires, from the food in the house to the temperature on the thermostat. Looking back at this passage with what you now know about their relationship, do you see this in a different light? Why do you think Nicola went to these lengths to bend to Tom&rsquo;s wishes?<BR><BR>7. The complexities of the marital abuse described in <i>Watching You</i> undermine some of the assumptions we often make about what gives someone power in a relationship. What power dynamics do we see in the various marriages in the novel? How do these fit or defy our expectations?<BR><BR>8. A cult of personality builds around Tom Fitzwilliam, although once disillusioned, Joey wonders what she saw in him. What do you think enables someone to have such a widespread draw? Have you known anyone who amassed that type of adoration in your own life? Are there other examples from popular culture who Tom reminded you of?<BR><BR>9. Considering what the men in her life have told her, Joey wonders if, &ldquo;while most women spent their lives searching for the perfect man, men sat around waiting to be chosen and then made the best of it&rdquo; (p. 313). Do you think this is true? Why, or why not?<BR><BR>10. While it is normal for people, and particularly for schoolgirls, to get crushes on someone they shouldn&rsquo;t become involved with, in <i>Watching You</i> some of these &ldquo;crushes&rdquo; appear to be unhealthy. Where is the line between infatuation and obsession? Who are some characters that you think fell on the infatuation side of that line? Who became dangerously obsessed? Looking at examples, what do you think distinguishes them?<BR><BR><b>Enhance Your Book Club</b><BR> <BR>1. At the end of the novel, we are left uncertain about what exactly happened to Viva Hart. What was the nature of her relationship with Tom Fitzwilliam? Did she commit suicide, or was she murdered? What do you think really happened in 1996? Have each person in your reading group share their theories, and vote to see who has the most convincing theory.<BR><BR>2. Although we see several different perspectives in the novel, we never are shown Tom, Nicola, Rebecca, Jack, or Alfie&rsquo;s points of view. Choose one of these characters and write a short story looking through their eyes. You can rewrite any scene in the book, or consider writing a flashback scene. Bring your short story to share and discuss with your reading group.<BR><BR>3.

The suggested questions are intended to help your reading group find new and interesting angles and topics for your discussion. We hope that these ideas will enrich your conversation and increase your enjoyment of the book.</i><BR> <BR> <b>Introduction</b><BR> <BR>In this taut, riveting debut, an unhappily childless and recently separated woman becomes fixated on her neighbor&#8212;the <i>actress. </i>Though she and the actress live just a few doors apart, a chasm of professional success and personal fulfillment lies between these two women. The actress, a celebrity with a charmed career, shares a gleaming brownstone with her handsome husband and their three adorable children, while the narrator, working in a dead-end job, lives in a run-down, three-story walk-up with her ex-husband&rsquo;s cat.<BR> <BR>An interaction with the actress at the annual block party takes a disastrous turn and what began as an innocent preoccupation turns into a stunning&#8212;and lethal&#8212;unravelling. Taking up questions of success, celebrity, women&rsquo;s roles, obsession, and privacy, <i>Looker </i>deftly reveals the perils of envy.<BR><BR> <b>Topics & Questions for Discussion</b><BR> <BR> 1. At the very beginning of the novel, the narrator says that the actress &ldquo;belongs to us. To our block, I mean,&rdquo; (page 1). Why does she correct herself? And how does this set up the narrator&rsquo;s increasingly intense feelings about the actress?<BR> <BR> 2. The narrator is very familiar with the actress&rsquo;s roles, thinking, for instance, of her breakout in <i>The Sultan of Hanover Street, </i>which she watched with Nathan. How does her engagement with the actress&rsquo;s many on-screen roles color her understanding of the actress as a wife, mother, and neighbor?<BR> <BR> 3. One of the reasons for the dissolution of the narrator&rsquo;s marriage seems to be that the narrator was unable to conceive a child. How does this impact the narrator&rsquo;s feelings about herself?<BR> <BR> 4. The narrator teaches her students that Emily Dickinson poems are &ldquo;full of sex and rage,&rdquo; (page 55). Why are these themes particularly resonant? Are there other ways of interpreting the poems she assigns?<BR> <BR> 5. When the narrator has lunch with her friend Shana, she at first believes she&rsquo;s getting &ldquo;appreciative looks&rdquo; from every man in the room (page 58), but then realizes this might not be the case. How does this shift in reality complicate your understanding of the narrator&rsquo;s reliability? What are other instances of her unreliability?<BR> <BR> 6. Describe the narrator&rsquo;s transition from tolerating Cat to desperately holding on to her. How does she convince herself that Cat belongs with her?<BR> <BR> 7. When the narrator feels insecure in front of her students, she wears an outfit that &ldquo;mirrors the one the actress wore to teach in every single scene of <i>Working Class</i>,&rdquo; (page 83). Why? How would you describe the narrator&rsquo;s feelings towards the actress?<BR> <BR> 8. The narrator fills up the room once intended for her and her husband&rsquo;s child with the actress&rsquo;s discarded family belongings, making the room into a kind of shrine. How do the narrator&rsquo;s changing feelings about these belongings illuminate her moods?<BR> <BR> 9. Why do you think the narrator is so fixated on the block party?<BR> <BR> 10. Why does the narrator engage with Bernardo? Is he the unstable one, or is she?<BR> <BR> 11. After her months-long obsession with the block party, the narrator&rsquo;s interaction with the actress does not go as expected. Why do you think the narrator, even after the incident with Nathan, chooses to go to the actress&rsquo;s house? What does she hope to get out of the experience?<BR> <BR> 12. The narrator assigns Elizabeth Bishop&rsquo;s &ldquo;One Art&rdquo; to her students (page 141). How does it speak to the way the narrator has responded to losing the things she once had&#8212;her job, her marriage, the possibility of a child?<BR> <BR> 13. On her final day with Cat, why does the narrator make the decision to act as she does? Is it planned, or an act of desperation?<BR> <BR> 14. The narrator envisions achieving a rapturous closeness with the actress as the novel comes to an end. Are these just fantasies, or are they more sinister than that?<BR> <BR> 15. How did you feel after spending so much time in the narrator&rsquo;s head? When you finished reading, did you have sympathy for her?

Their past, too traumatic to be remembered regularly, is forgotten by everyone, save one&#8212;the historian. This demanding role has been bestowed on Yetu.<BR> <BR>Yetu remembers for everyone, and the memories, painful and wonderful, traumatic and terrible and miraculous, are destroying her. And so, she flees to the surface, escaping the memories, the expectations, and the responsibilities&#8212;and discovers a world her people left behind long ago.<BR> <BR>Yetu will learn more than she ever expected to about her own past&#8212;and about the future of her people. If they are all to survive, they&rsquo;ll need to reclaim the memories, reclaim their identity&#8212;and own who they really are.<BR> <BR>Inspired by a song produced by the rap group Clipping for the <i>This American Life</i> episode &ldquo;We Are In The Future,&rdquo; <i>The Deep </i>is vividly original and uniquely affecting.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>This impeccably researched and &ldquo;adventure-packed&rdquo; (<i>The Washington Post</i>) account of the obsessive quest by Christopher Columbus&rsquo;s son to create the greatest library in the world is &ldquo;the stuff of Hollywood blockbusters&rdquo; (NPR) and offers a vivid picture of Europe on the verge of becoming modern.</b><BR><BR>At the peak of the Age of Exploration, Hernando Col&#243;n sailed with his father Christopher Columbus on his final voyage to the New World, a journey that ended in disaster, bloody mutiny, and shipwreck. After Columbus&rsquo;s death in 1506, eighteen-year-old Hernando sought to continue&#8212;and surpass&#8212;his father&rsquo;s campaign to explore the boundaries of the known world by building a library that would collect everything ever printed: a vast holding organized by summaries and catalogues; really, the first ever database for the exploding diversity of written matter as the printing press proliferated across Europe. Hernando traveled extensively and obsessively amassed his collection based on the groundbreaking conviction that a library of universal knowledge should include &ldquo;all books, in all languages and on all subjects,&rdquo; even material often dismissed: ballads, erotica, news pamphlets, almanacs, popular images, romances, fables. The loss of part of his collection to another maritime disaster in 1522, set off the final scramble to complete this sublime project, a race against time to realize a vision of near-impossible perfection.<BR> <BR>&ldquo;Magnificent&hellip;a thrill on almost every page&rdquo; (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>), <i>The Catalogue of Shipwrecked Books</i> is a window into sixteenth-century Europe&rsquo;s information revolution, and a reflection of the passion and intrigues that lie beneath our own insatiable desires to bring order to the world today.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>The incredible true story of the twelve boys trapped with their coach in a flooded cave in Thailand and their inspiring rescue.</b><BR><BR>On June 23rd, 2018, twelve members of the Wild Boars soccer team and their coach were exploring the Tham Luang Nang Non cave complex in northern Thailand when disaster struck. A rainy season downpour flooded the tunnels, trapping them as they took shelter on a shelf of the dark cave. Eight days of searching yielded no signs of life, but on July 2nd they were discovered by two British divers. The boys and their coach were eventually rescued in an international operation that took three days. What could have been a terrible tragedy became an amazing story of survival.<BR> <BR>Award-winning author Marc Aronson brings us the backstory behind how this astounding rescue took place. <i>Rising Water </i>highlights the creative thinking and technology that made a successful mission possible by examining the physical, environmental, and psychological factors surrounding the rescue. From the brave Thai Navy SEAL who lost his life while placing oxygen tanks along the passageways of the cave, to the British divers that ultimately swam the boys to safety, to the bravery of the boys and their coach, this is the breathtaking rescue that captivated the entire world.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>Teaching Students How To Write Their First Research Papers: A Research Guide Using Marc Aronson&rsquo;s <i>Trapped</i> and <i>Rising Water</i></b><BR><BR><b><u>Book Summaries</u></b><BR> <BR><b><i>Trapped: How the World Rescued 33 Miners from 2,000 Feet Below the Chilean Desert</i></b> is the gripping, true story of the thirty-three hardy miners trapped in a Chilean mine for over two months. Based on interviews, news reports, and other research, Aronson uses a dual narrative of &ldquo;Above&rdquo; and &ldquo;Below&rdquo; to describe the tension and high emotions surrounding both the survival of the miners and the rescue effort to save them. Photos of the mine site, maps of the San Jos&#233; Mine, and illustrations of the massive equipment used in the rescue effort greatly enhance the reader experience; the counterpoint of light and darkness is both illuminating and terrifying. This true story reads like a suspenseful tale of desperation and triumph. <BR> <BR><b><i>Rising Water: The Story of the Thai Cave Rescue</i></b> is the true story of the Wild Boars, a Thai soccer team that got lost in Tham Luang cave and captured the attention of the world. <i>Rising Water </i>describes the international rescue operation in which cave-diving experts from all over the world collaborated on this delicate mission, factoring in concern for their own safety and for that of the trapped soccer team and coach. The boys needed to be rescued underwater, but how? Aronson tells a dramatic tale of death and life, of remorse and redemption, filled with as many twists and turns as the cave itself.<BR><BR><b><u>Writing a Research Guide</u></b><BR> <BR>You&rsquo;ve assigned your students to create their own book-based research project. You explain that you do not want a summary of the book, but an actual report on an original topic related to the book. Using issues related to <i>Rising Water </i>and <i>Trapped</i>, this guide will lead you through the process for any research topic. <BR> <BR>When teaching good research techniques, remember QVC: Quality, Vetting, Compatibility.<BR> <BR><b>Quality</b>: Provide high quality resources for your students. You may automatically offer print resources and require one or more of them; however, don&rsquo;t assume that using books and magazines exclusively teaches students good research skills. Instead, encourage the use of the Internet. One way to do this safely is with a WebQuest. Collaborate with another classroom teacher or school librarian to discuss different research topics the students may be interested in. Then create a simple website (any wiki creator will do) with links to factual, unbiased URLs presenting cogent information. Some examples may include:<BR> <BR><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/destinations/united-states/florida/two-divers-die-in-eagles-nest-cave/">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/destinations/united-states/florida/two-divers-die-in-eagles-nest-cave/</a><BR> <BR><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2013/07/13/world/americas/chilean-mine-rescue/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2013/07/13/world/americas/chilean-mine-rescue/index.html</a><BR> <BR>These types of websites are easy to find with Google searches, but they are not the first links on the page (Wikipedia is the first in both cases); that is why you may want to provide them online in the form of a WebQuest. Also, this gives you the opportunity to differentiate instruction and include regular and special education students by creating different WebQuests for different class levels, if appropriate.<BR> <BR><b>Vetting</b>: Some students will Google for answers regardless of your suggestions, so teach some simple online vetting skills. Allow your students to Google research topics, but insist on vetting. One way of vetting without penalty to the researcher is to require that students provide information about the website similar to an annotated citation. Have them provide information on the creator or owner of the website, the author, date created, name of the page, and most important, their rationale for using this website and accepting it as valid. Where did the author get the information? If it is from outdated or discredited sources, that should affect your decision to use it. This self-reflection often weeds out poor sources. The process may not prevent students from using unvetted websites, but it will enhance their skills by making them think about and identify their sources, the first step to successful vetting. Students can usually find the creator of the website on the About tab, often located at the very bottom of the webpage.<BR> <BR>If you are a strict user of print resources, you can explain that the great thing about using print resources is that vetting them is much easier than vetting websites, and the information needed, like author, title, page numbers, and publisher, is easily found. <BR> <BR><b>Compatibility</b>: The easiest way to teach students to find research compatible with their chosen topic is to teach them to search targeted topics online. The most powerful online searching tool is the use of quotation marks. Consider the following searches* based on <i>Rising Water</i>:<BR> <BR>-thai cave rescue&#8212;4,790,000 hits<BR> <BR>-&ldquo;thai cave rescue&rdquo;&#8212;1,360,000 hits<BR> <BR>-&ldquo;thai cave rescue&rdquo; map AND timeline&#8212;92,500 hits<BR> <BR>-&ldquo;thai cave rescue map&rdquo; AND timeline&#8212;538 hits<BR> <BR>*Google Chrome downloads as of 2/14/19<BR> <BR>The issue is not using the Internet, it is searching on the Internet. Note how quotation marks reduce the hits from 4,790,000 to 477. Teach your students to search in phrases surrounded by quotation marks. Some sample searches include:<BR> <BR><b><i>Trapped</i>: </b><BR> <BR>&ldquo;33 miners trapped&rdquo;<BR> <BR>&ldquo;copper mining in chile&rdquo; danger<BR> <BR>&ldquo;san jose mine chile&rdquo;<BR> <BR>&ldquo;common uses of copper&rdquo;<BR> <BR>&ldquo;nazca plate&rdquo; tectonics chile<BR> <BR>&ldquo;hephaestus god of the forge&rdquo;<BR> <BR><b><i>Rising Water</i>:</b><BR> <BR>&ldquo;tham luang cave&rdquo; AND &ldquo;wild boars&rdquo;<BR> <BR>&ldquo;cave diving accidents&rdquo;<BR> <BR>&ldquo;thai SEALs&rdquo;<BR> <BR>&ldquo;history of soccer timeline&rdquo;<BR> <BR>&ldquo;cave diving" AND "most dangerous sport&rdquo;<BR> <BR>&ldquo;international rescue efforts" "natural disaster&rdquo;<BR> <BR><b>Practice:</b> Dr. Aronson had to approach <i>Trapped</i> and <i>Rising Water</i> like a student researcher: he brainstormed, exploring topics surrounding mine disasters and cave diving rescues, searching for significant aspects and people to decide what was important, relevant, and most interesting to his audience; those decisions became the books. Offer students that same opportunity for exploration by providing a series of links where they can access overarching information about the Thailand cave situation, such as <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44791998">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44791998</a>, as well as sites that discuss more specific topics like the potential for an event to cause Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/639433/Chilean-miners-the-33-antontonio-banderas-juan-illanes-San-Jose-mine">https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/639433/Chilean-miners-the-33-antontonio-banderas-juan-illanes-San-Jose-mine</a>. This can be done in writing or online if you use a classroom platform like Google Classroom or Edmodo. Discuss with students which facts or experiences from these articles they notice in <i>Rising Water</i>, and why Dr. Aronson might have decided to include them.<BR><BR><b><u>Research Process </u></b> <BR> <BR>Consider sharing the Model of the Information Search Process chart found at <a href="http://wp.comminfo.rutgers.edu/ckuhlthau/information-search-process/">http://wp.comminfo.rutgers.edu/ckuhlthau/information-search-process/</a> with your students as a helpful guide. The model is based on Kuhlthau&rsquo;s 1991 Information Search Process.<BR> <BR>When brainstorming with your students, you already have great resources a few pages away. In both <i>Trapped </i>and <i>Rising Water</i>, Dr. Aronson describes his research process and maps out how he approached quickly compiling and organizing the disparate topics and massive amount of information needed for a book. In the notes and bibliography sections, he also tells readers where he found all his information. These tools can be used as models for a basic, annotated search process. Dr. Aronson used the following steps once he had his topic:<BR> <BR> -Brainstormed format and method.<BR> <BR> -Outlined what he thought he needed in detail.<BR> <BR> -Employed time and energy to procure multimedia data, some of which worked its way into the final book and some of which did not. Take this opportunity to teach students that it&rsquo;s perfectly fine not to include all data in the final product; it is always more fruitful to collect more than they will use.<BR> <BR> -Organized the data into connected sections.<BR> <BR> -Separated the useful data from the irrelevant data.<BR> <BR> -Wrote and rewrote based on an outline that he had been revising and expanding during the entire research project, since things will change during research.<BR> <BR>You can adjust Dr. Aronson&rsquo;s steps based on your students&rsquo; needs and project timeline, integrating elements from the author&rsquo;s notes that are most helpful. Then move on to these six detailed activities with your students as you continue the process.<BR> <BR>1. <b>Initiation: </b>Brainstorm topics in class, discussing some of the specific issues involved with these topics. Ask students to start thinking about what topic and issue sound most interesting to them.<BR> <BR>2. <b>Selection of a topic</b>: This is often the most difficult step because the possibilities are seemingly endless; some students get caught up and become overwhelmed. You may want to provide a list of suggested topics without necessarily limiting students to the list. For instance, go to the sources sections of Dr. Aronson&rsquo;s books and start from a broad category like mining, diving, drilling, caving, or copper. Then ask your students to narrow down the topic by asking questions of interest using the five W&rsquo;s (Who, What, Where, When, Why). Why is copper so important that people are willing to risk death to mine it? How much does a gigantic drill like the Strata 950 cost? What is it made of? How are the dangers of cave diving similar to those for all types of diving? How are they different? Hopefully, having students ask these questions will result in a researchable topic of interest.<BR> <BR>3.<b> Explore the topic: </b>This is a good time to hit the encyclopedias, books, magazines, and online databases. Have your students build a background in their topics. Let them learn the lingo, understand the important concepts, and be able to develop the questions they want to answer. Facilitate as needed, but they will own the project much more if you allow them freedom of choice (as long as the choice is reasonable). Let them also decide if this is the topic for them; if they want to change, now is the time.<BR> <BR>4. <b>Formulate the topic:</b> This is a perfect time to introduce outlining, either formal or bulleted. Students start to create a logical timeline or progression of points for their papers. Students can simply start with a list of questions, and then answer them through their research. Their outline is their list. Outlining is another self-reflective activity that forces students to question their topics and to begin to see the sense in their arguments; for instance, they learn that copper is essential in electronics, discover that cave diving is a popular activity when they visit <a href="https://www.madacaves.com/">https://www.madacaves.com/</a>, or realize that poorly maintained mines are connected to socioeconomic conditions near the mines, etc.<BR> <BR>5. <b>Collect the data. </b>Students have already decided on a topic and outlined it; now is the time to collect the information that will be used in the research paper. Remember that the best way to get students thinking about sourcing is to require justifications, as described above, for using that particular source over a database or print item. Reasons will often include timeliness of the data; for example, students may not find many books about the Thai cave rescue because this may be the first. Remind students that lots of data provides lots of choices; limited data provides limited choices. At this point, more is more; during editing, less will be more.<BR> <BR>6. <b>Present the data/Write the paper.</b> This is the time to teach students how to write a thesis statement and a research paragraph. Once they know how to do that, all they will need is an introduction and conclusion.<BR> <BR>A thesis statement is the engine of the paper, and should be either the first or last sentence of the introduction. It provides significance and power to all the points being made within. It usually provides setting or context to the issue, and a brief statement of the problem within that issue. For example, &ldquo;In Chilean mining, the 2010 accident caused repercussions in the mining industry that are still felt today&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Thai cave rescue operation of 2018 demonstrated the extreme dangers of cave diving.&rdquo;<BR> <BR>Think of a research paragraph like a sandwich. The top bun is the introduction of the data, where students situate the data, place it in context, and/or prepare the reader for it. The middle is the meat, the data itself; it can be raw, like cheese (primary citation), or cooked by the author, like hamburger (secondary citation). The bottom bun is the explanation of why the data is significant, what makes it align to the thesis statement, what makes it indispensable to this paper. Try not to ask for extremely long paragraphs; at this level, students are better off making one or two points well than four points poorly. Once students have research paragraphs, introductions, and conclusions, then you are ready to rock. Good luck!<BR> <BR><b>Bonus Activity:</b> Work with students to compile a list of people in the book or other experts in cave diving or mining that they&rsquo;d like to contact, or consider reaching out to professional organizations with which they are associated. Request information and/or interviews for students to use in their research projects. Primary sources are always strongly recommended, and often interesting to track down; feel free to contact them via social media as well, or read another book that they&rsquo;ve written.<BR><BR><b><u>Projects/Extension Activities</u></b><BR> <BR>Offering extension activities enables and empowers students to think outside of the box, to let their creativity flow, and to allow them more control and autonomy over their assignments, generating more self-driven interest. Research on interest theory shows that student engagement depends on several factors like purposeful assignments, authentic topics, and the autonomy to achieve ownership of the material. Writing and researching are reflective and reflexive activities, and projects are most successful with eager engagement from students.<BR> <BR>1. Have students work together to create a map of either the Chilean mine or the Thai cave. Can you make it in three dimensions? What are some of the challenges in making a map? Remember, the accuracy of a mine map could mean the difference between life and death for someone trapped inside.<BR> <BR>2. Have each student choose one of the Wild Boars or one of miners and write his narrative, making sure to use lots of details from the experience to make it sound authentic. Remember that the more imagery and descriptive language that writers use, the more alive the experience becomes. Students can also consider writing from the perspective of one of the rescuers, politicians, or family members instead.<BR> <BR>3. Have students create a comparison/contrast between the rescues in these two books, or between one of the books and another true rescue effort. How do the people being rescued react as compared with the rescuers? What physical or natural obstacles prevent an easy rescue? Are there differences in how viral the event becomes? Do people in different parts of the world respond differently to disaster? Do they react similarly?<BR> <BR>4. Using some construction paper, pens, pencils, and markers, ask students to create a board game based on the book they&rsquo;ve read. Cards can contain questions to be answered or facts to be used to complete the game. The board can even look like a cave. Students can also download maps of the country, the region, and the cave itself to use in the game; perhaps surrounding towns are stops in the game.<BR> <BR>5. Help students see that in both books, tent cities instantly appeared as family members of the miners and soccer players gathered for information and comfort. Have them take a look at Hooverville, the name for every tent city that appeared during the Great Depression. Although they came into being in very different ways for very different reasons, are they also similar in what they provide and do not provide? What other qualities do tent cities have? Are they homes for the stateless?<BR><BR><i>Guide written by Bruce DuBoff, who spent twenty-five years in education, mostly as a middle-school librarian; he is also a past president of the NJ Association of School Librarians.

The suggested questions are intended to help your reading group find new and interesting angles and topics for your discussion. We hope that these ideas will enrich your conversation and increase your enjoyment of the book.</i><BR> <BR> <b>Introduction</b><BR> <BR> <i>Be careful who you let in.</i><BR> <BR> Soon after her twenty-fifth birthday, Libby Jones returns home from work to find the letter she&rsquo;s been waiting for her entire life. She rips it open with one driving thought: <i>I am finally going to know who I am. </i>She learns not only the identity of her parents, but also that she is the sole inheritor of their abandoned mansion on the banks of the Thames in London&rsquo;s fashionable Chelsea neighborhood. The home, even in its dilapidated state, is worth millions. Everything in her life is about to change. What she doesn&rsquo;t know is that others have been waiting for this day as well&#8212;and although they&rsquo;ve been in hiding, they are now heading her way.<BR> <BR> Twenty-five years ago, police were called to 16 Cheyne Walk with reports of a baby crying. When they arrived, they found a healthy ten-month-old safe and sound in the bedroom. In the kitchen, three dead bodies, all dressed in black, were seemingly posed next to a hastily scrawled note. The four other children reported to live at Cheyne Walk were gone.<BR> <BR> In <i>The Family Upstairs</i>, the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Then She Was Gone</i> and master of &ldquo;bone-chilling suspense&rdquo; (<i>People</i>) delivers another powerful and propulsive story of two families living in a house with the darkest of secrets.<BR> <BR> <b>Topics & Questions for Discussion </b><BR> <BR> 1. <i>The Family Upstairs</i> is told from three perspectives: Henry, Lucy, and Libby&rsquo;s. Was there one character in particular whose point of view you especially enjoyed? What is the effect of having Henry&rsquo;s sections told in first person narration and Lucy and Libby&rsquo;s told in third person narration? Why do you think Lisa Jewell structured her novel this way?<BR> <BR> 2. Henry, rightfully, hates David. Yet, Henry and David share many similar tendencies and qualities. Compare and contrast the two men.<BR> <BR> 3. There are many intriguing characters who do not directly narrate the novel. Is there a character whose point of view you&rsquo;d have liked to had included? What do you think Martina, for example, thought about David and Birdie&rsquo;s choices?<BR> <BR> 4. What is the effect of characters calling Libby &ldquo;the baby&rdquo; throughout the novel? How does this inform your opinion of Libby and her role in the story?<BR> <BR> 5. Which of adult Henry, Lucy, and Clemency&rsquo;s behaviors can you directly trace back to their harrowing experiences as children? How do you see the influence of their abuse in their grown up lives?<BR> <BR> 6. The relationship between Henry and Phin is pivotal to the plot, but we aren&rsquo;t told as much about the friendship between Lucy and Clemency. What details do we glean about their relationship from Henry and Lucy&rsquo;s memories and Clemency&rsquo;s account toward the end of the novel?<BR> <BR> 7. What types of power are wielded in this novel? Who has power, who loses it, and who wants it? Is there a character without any agency?<BR> <BR> 8. Do you think Henry&rsquo;s lies and violent acts were born out of his need to survive an unimaginable situation, or do you think there is, as Clemency states, &ldquo;a streak of pure evil&rdquo; (page 280) in him?<BR> <BR> 9. Lucy and Clemency experienced unspeakable abuse as children, but, miraculously, they managed to break the cycle and become good mothers to their children. What are their relationships like with their children? What makes them good moms?<BR> <BR> 10. After Clemency tells Henry that her father tried to con his own family once, Henry decides he must act against David. As he remembers his conversation with Clemency, he thinks, &ldquo;It was a fork in the road, really. Looking back on it there were so many other ways to have got through the trauma of it all, but with all the people I loved most in the world facing away from me I chose the worst possible option&rdquo; (page 274). While Henry claims he would have resorted to less violent ways of escaping the Lamb house, do you really believe him? Or do you think part of him wanted revenge?<BR> <BR> 11. Libby finds many disconcerting traces of the house&rsquo;s previous inhabitants when she tours it. Which artifacts did you find the eeriest? Which intrigued you and made you want to find out what had happened inside the house?<BR> <BR> 12. In your opinion, who is the most tragic figure in this novel? Do they experience healing or redemption?<BR> <BR> <b>Enhance Your Book Club </b><BR> <BR> 1. When Libby tells Dido that she and Miller are investigating her past and the home she inherited, Dido insists on helping, saying she may be useful because, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read every Agatha Christie novel ever published. Twice&rdquo; (page 99). Choose one of Agatha Christie&rsquo;s mysteries set at a family home with a dark secret, such as <i>Crooked House</i> or <i>Peril at End House</i>, and discuss how Lisa Jewell and Agatha Christie use family homes to similar or different effects.<BR> <BR> 2. With its atmospheric setting, dark mystery, and twists and turns, <i>The Family Upstairs</i> seems like the perfect book to adapt to a movie. Who would you cast as its stars? Discuss as a group how a director might adapt a book with so many narrators and perspectives.<BR> <BR> 3. Many of the characters in this novel survived abusive relationships of various types. As a group, consider volunteering at a local women and children&rsquo;s shelter to support those in your community who are recovering from their own traumas.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[&quot;Narrators Tamaryn Payne, Bea Holland, and Dominic Thornburn shine in Jewell&#39;s latest dark, twisted story about history, family, and sacrifice. When Libby turns 25, she receives a long awaited letter notifying her about her biological parents and about the inheritance of an abandoned mansion in London. At the same time we meet Lucy, a young, homeless woman with two children who is desperate to get back to London. Finally Henry&#39;s perspective is shared in retrospect as he reminisces about his own upbringing, providing compelling backstory. As the three stories collide, the narrators create a creepy and compelling atmosphere. Listeners will be totally caught up in the story the closer Lucy, Libby, and Henry get to the truth about what happened in that house.&quot;]]></d104>

There&rsquo;s the melody that reminds her of the summer she spent rubbing baby oil on her stomach in pursuit of the perfect tan. A dance beat that makes her think of using a fake ID to slip into a nightclub. A dirge that marked the years she spent trying to get pregnant.<BR> <BR> <i>For better or for worse, music is the language of memory. It is also the language of love.</i><BR> <BR> In the aftermath of a series of personal tragedies, Zoe throws herself into her career as a music therapist. When an unexpected friendship slowly blossoms into love, she makes plans for a new life, but to her shock and inevitable rage, some people&#8212;even those she loves and trusts most&#8212;don&rsquo;t want that to happen.<BR> <BR> <i>Sing You Home </i>is about identity, love, marriage, and parenthood. It&rsquo;s about people wanting to do the right thing for the greater good, even as they work to fulfill their own personal desires and dreams. And it&rsquo;s about what happens when the outside world brutally calls into question the very thing closest to our hearts: <i>family.</i>]]></d104>

Box, #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author), a deadly plot against the president&rsquo;s life emerges from the shadows of the Deep State. </b><BR><BR>Recently elected President Richard Monroe&#8212;populist, controversial, and divisive&#8212;is at the center of an increasingly polarized Washington, DC. Never has the partisan drama been so tense or the paranoia so rampant. In the midst of contentious political turf wars, the White House chief of staff is found dead in his house and West Wing intern and ex-Army grunt Hayley Chill is positive that it&rsquo;s not from natural causes.<BR> <BR>Determined to find the truth, Hayley uncovers shocking evidence that a wide-ranging conspiracy is running beneath the surface of DC in an effort to undermine the rule of law&#8212;and democracy itself. Soon, Hayley is in a race against time to reveal the truth and save the life of the next victim: the president.<BR> <BR> &ldquo;<i>Deep State</i> rings eerily true [and] will keep you turning pages well into the night&rdquo; (Jack Carr, former Navy SEAL and author of <i>The Terminal List</i>).]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[&quot;Narrator Marin Ireland inhabits Haley Chill as the tenacious former military boxer takes on the role of a White House intern who must deal with the attempted coup of a recently elected president. Dark forces threaten the pillars of democracy and the rule of law when Haley finds her boss, the chief of staff, murdered. Ireland&#39;s delivery matches the quickening pace and ramped-up tension as the conspiracy unfolds. Hauty uses his screenwriting skills to deliver technicolor scenes of the conspirators and the unlikely heroine. This deep state is real, and people are dying to keep it from being revealed. Moreover, there&#39;s a twist that elevates this thriller, so don&#39;t be surprised if you find your jaw on the floor as the last few minutes unspool.&quot;]]></d104>

And, to make matters worse, there&rsquo;s a strange girl following him around wherever he goes.

She details the powers that Gary developed after his transformative time being healed by Aborigines, including telepathy, seeing the inner workings of his patients&rsquo; bodies, and channeling the healing energy of the universe. She discloses how Gary accessed the Dreamtime, the energy field that is the source of reality, and reveals how her work with Gary led her to an invitation to participate in secret Aboriginal women&rsquo;s ceremonies in the harsh Outback desert, where her own healing powers blossomed. <BR> <BR>Through her story of healing and discovery, Robbie describes principles from the 60,000-year-old Aboriginal culture that can help create transformation in your life. She explains how she became aware of her team of spirit guides, who provide unwavering support and unconditional love through each of life&rsquo;s struggles. She shares the tenderness of her husband&rsquo;s final moments and how she worked past her grief to transform her relationship with him, enabling him to become an active, loving part of her spirit team and partner in her healing work.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>Chapter 53 <BR>Thunderstorms </b> <BR> <BR>The ceremonies built in intensity, each one more powerful than the one before it. <BR> <BR>I was walking around in a glow of gratitude to Mother Earth. Today was our last day for ceremony. I tried not to have expectations, but I sensed something big was about to happen. I spent most of the morning wondering what it would be. <BR> <BR>&ldquo;Ceremony! Ceremony!&rdquo; Melody yelled from the far end of the camp. <BR> <BR><i>Looks like I&rsquo;m about to find out</i>, I thought, as I pulled off my clothes and stepped into my dusty black skirt. Determined not to be late for ceremony today, still yanking up my skirt I ran toward the Aborigines&rsquo; side of the camp. <BR> <BR>Uncharacteristically, I was one of the first to arrive. I sat front and center at the edge of the ceremony site where the Aborigines would be dancing. <i>Best seat in the house</i>, I thought. <i>How perfect for my last day</i>. <BR> <BR>It didn&rsquo;t take long for the other women to arrive. We were all naked except for our long black skirts. Gazing around, I marveled at seeing such a wide range of radiant skin colors represented. Between the white women and the Aborigines, we were fair skinned to dark ebony and everything in between. <BR> <BR>I shifted my legs underneath me as I settled my body into the sandy dirt. The Aborigines started singing in their native tongue. A few of the white women started clapping to the beat. It was fascinating watching the dancers. Despite the discomfort of sitting in the hot sun with my back aching, I was spellbound. I couldn&rsquo;t understand what the Aborigines were singing, but through their powerful song and dance they were able to convey gratitude. I felt warmth intensifying inside me. Huge waves of gratitude were welling up and rippling through my body. <BR> <BR>I noticed a large dragonfly hovering close to the head of one of the dancing Aborigines. As I stared at it, the dragonfly seemed to blend into the leaves of the scraggly trees behind it, as if it were part of the landscape. Then I noticed the same thing was happening with the dancing Aborigines. They were blending into the background of large red rocks and puffy white clouds in the bright blue sky. <BR> <BR>Everything shimmered and seemed to melt together. Although I could distinctly see each object, it felt as if there was no separation between them. Each person and object rolled off infinitely into the next and the next and the next. I felt a sense of boundless interconnectedness between everything. <BR> <BR>My heart began to expand until it expanded far beyond my body. I felt intense love and compassion flowing from it. An airy feeling came over me, as if there was no time and space. This went beyond any intellectual knowing--I could <i>feel</i> there was no time and space! I lost all sense of where I began and ended. It felt like everything was interconnected in a timeless, boundless consciousness. And I knew, with the kind of knowing that encompasses your whole being, that I was part of this infinite consciousness. In an instant I knew this One-Consciousness wasn&rsquo;t only within me and everything around me, it stretched infinitely beyond the cosmos, beyond our universe. The intensity of the love coming from this interconnected consciousness struck me to the heart. <BR> <BR>After several minutes, I took a deep breath and placed my hands on my heart. <i>Thank you, thank you, thank you, my dear Aboriginal brethren, for helping me feel the loving consciousness that is a part of me</i>, I said silently. <BR> <BR>Pulling my knees toward my chest, I wrapped my arms around my<b> </b>legs and basked in the delicious glow of the moment. I closed my eyes and listened to the beautiful singing with indiscernible lyrics but a meaning I could clearly feel in my heart. <BR> <BR>As the ceremony ended we walked back in silence to our campground. A half hour later as I approached the makeshift kitchen a loud <i>ping</i> caught my attention. There was a second loud <i>ping</i> as another heavy raindrop hit the metal roof of the chuck wagon that held our food supplies. Within seconds, the metal roof was filled with loud dancing raindrops bouncing off the top. As a loud crack of thunder sounded overhead, I ran to take shelter in the tent I shared with Karyn. I was caught in a downpour before I reached the tent. The warm rain felt so good against my dirty hair and skin. I reached out my arms and looked up at the dark clouds overhead and let it pour over me. <BR> <BR>The storms were intense and lasted many hours. <BR> <BR>It was a tremendous downpour. We watched the rolling purple, blue, and gray clouds and sheets of rain circling the camp. It poured on us for a while and then moved off across the flat desert to the horizon, the lightning flashes and thunder rumbles reaching us from far away. Then the storm turned and approached the camp again. As it hit, we ducked for cover and crowded inside the truck and Jeep like clowns stuffed in a circus car. This pattern repeated over and over. Sometimes we stood outside and enjoyed the rain on our matted hair and filthy bodies. <BR> <BR>When the clouds moved away, we stood on top of the truck to see Uluru in its glorious purple color. In this land of constant sun, Uluru was normally colored orange. Seeing it in its purple regalia was a rare sight. <BR> <BR>The rain went on into the night. For the Aborigines there was also a spiritual aspect to thunderstorms. The lightning rebalances the world and the rain cleanses. I think all of us felt the renewal. <BR> <BR>I learned later, from a hotel clerk, that the desert had not seen such storms for many years. Karyn told me that the Aboriginal women felt the white women&rsquo;s spiritual energy had greatly improved the strength of this year&rsquo;s storms.]]></d104>

By 1988 he was a quadriplegic. Then, in 1994, his doctors told him he had two years to live. Desperate and depressed, he followed a synchronistic suggestion and went to Australia to live with a remote Aboriginal tribe. Arriving in a wheelchair, alone, with almost no feeling left from the neck down, Holz embarked on a remarkable healing transformation of body, mind, and spirit and discovered his own gift for healing others. <BR> <BR>Written at the request of the Aboriginal healers Holz worked with, this book reveals the beliefs and principles of the 60,000-year-old healing system of the Aborigines of Australia, the world&rsquo;s oldest continuous culture. Chronicling the step-by-step process that led to his miraculous recovery, he explains the role played by thought in the creation of health or disease and details the five essential steps in the Aboriginal healing process. He explores the use of dreamtime, spirit guides, and telepathy to discover and reprogram the subconscious motivations behind illness--a process that enacts healing at the cellular and the soul level, where the root of physical illness is found. <BR> <BR>Supported by modern science, including quantum physics, Aboriginal medicine enables each of us to tap in to healing support through the power of the body/mind/spirit connection.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<B>PROLOGUE <BR>A SINGLE STEP</B> <BR> <BR>According to my doctors, I was not supposed to be alive today. But I am. My healing was not accomplished through modern medicine, with wonder drugs and technologies. No. For me the healing began on the other side of the world in the Australian Outback, with ways that are as ancient as the human race itself. <BR> <BR>My journey began with a single step--a step I took on my way to yet another business meeting. My left foot didn&rsquo;t lift properly, it was dragging a little as I walked. But my life had enough problems. I told myself I must have strained a muscle. The next day my foot was normal and I forgot about it. <BR> <BR>But the &ldquo;dragging&rdquo; returned. The scuff marks across the top of my shoe proved I wasn&rsquo;t imagining the weakness in my left foot or the tingling numbness. It was real. Too real. I decided I had pinched a nerve in my foot that would disappear in time. <BR> <BR>For several months I experienced periods of numbness and tingling followed by periods of normalcy. But I was troubled when the area of numbness increased. It worked its way from the left foot to the left calf. Then it started in the right foot and worked its way to the right calf. <BR> <BR>My high-tech aerospace company was growing rapidly and demanding most of my time and attention. I had no time for symptoms, for pinched nerves, for any distraction. So I bought a cane at a local drug store. I would have continued living this way indefinitely if I hadn&rsquo;t awoke one morning and discovered that the numb feeling now had spread to my groin area. It was taking over my sense of maleness. Using a cane was one thing, but this was something altogether different. That day I called to arrange for tests at Scripps Clinic in La Jolla, California. <BR> <BR>What happened next knocked the wind out of me. <BR> <BR>&ldquo;At this point the most educated guess says you are suffering from chronic progressive MS--multiple sclerosis.&rdquo; I was speechless. All I could do was cling to the words &ldquo;educated guess.&rdquo; Maybe the doctor was wrong. He had admitted that multiple sclerosis was difficult to diagnose. I could be suffering from stress. My first marriage had ended in divorce, my second marriage was rapidly heading for the same, my children were cold and distant, and there was the pressure of running my business. That was it, I was certain. I just needed some rest. <BR> <BR>As my mind continued to marshal its arguments, the doctor continued. &ldquo;We can give you medication that will ease the pain. Unfortunately, there is no known cause for multiple sclerosis, and therefore we have no cure.&rdquo; <BR> <BR>No <I>cure</I>. <BR> <BR>Those two words stopped the chatter of my mind and began to repeat like a broken record. <I>No cure</I>. <I>No cure</I>. The doctor droned on in a voice so flat he could have been lecturing to a classroom of bored medical students. <BR> <BR>There would be periods when I would experience an increase in pain and symptoms--an &ldquo;exacerbation.&rdquo; The symptoms would decline in intensity with time, but there would sometimes be a permanent result such as numbness. <BR> <BR>Then in a slightly softer voice--as if he finally remembered he was talking to the patient, the one for whom there was &ldquo;no cure&rdquo;--he added, &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s no comfort but the reality is, we simply don&rsquo;t know how this will affect your life. The course of the disease varies from person to person. It&rsquo;s impossible to know what course yours will take or how severe it will become.&rdquo; <BR> <BR>I seemed to be outside myself, watching the entire scene from someplace else--someplace safe. Where was my reaction to this news? I should have been horrified. But somehow, no emotions came. I felt no fear, no anger, no self&#8209;pity, no sorrow. I felt nothing. Just emptiness. <BR> <BR>The next seven years of my life were a nightmare. <BR> <BR>For four years I continued dragging myself around airports and boardrooms, forcing myself to &ldquo;walk&rdquo; on two canes because I was afraid that once I got into a wheelchair I&rsquo;d never get out again. Finally, in 1988, I gave in. I got a chair. That was also the year that I began taking a liter of Prednisone a day through an IV. I thought things couldn&rsquo;t get much worse. <BR> <BR>But they did. In 1994 my doctor told me I was losing the battle. My internal organs were shutting down. I should begin to get my affairs in order. I had two years to live--at most. <BR> <BR>Two years. I was forty-three years old. By then I was spending most of my time in a wheelchair, had almost no feeling in my body, was catheterized, and could barely lift my arms to feed myself. Even so, I knew I was not ready to die. There was still so much that I wanted to experience. My desperation was deep and black, and I felt totally alone. <BR> <BR>And then a series of what I would have called strange coincidences occurred. <BR> <BR>Seeking relief from the unrelenting depression, I stopped in at a local jazz club. I happened to encounter a naturopath from Australia who happened to know some extraordinary healers in an Aboriginal tribe in the Australian Outback. She happened to have the phone number of one, Ray Gelar, which she gave to me. <BR> <BR>That was all strange enough, but even stranger was the strong urge I had to call him. It was completely out of character for me, but I did it. I called Ray. I asked him if he could help me. <BR> <BR>A week later this man--who had devoted his life to physics, to logic, to hard cold facts--rolled his wheelchair onto a plane bound for Australia. Part of me thought I was insane. But another part of me was saying this was my only chance. What did I have to lose?]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[A guide to the benefits and challenges of the use of cannabis in spiritual practice <BR> <BR>&bull; Includes chapters by 18 authoritative and influential voices of the modern cannabis movement, including Kathleen Harrison, Joan Bello, Hamilton Souther, Steven Hager, Chris Bennett, Dee Dussault, Jeremy Wolff, and Roger Christie <BR> <BR>&bull; Explores the use of marijuana in a wide range of spiritual practices, including meditation, yoga, chanting, visualization, shamanism, group ceremonies, work with other entheogens, and as a creative aid <BR> <BR>Truly a medicine for body and soul, one of cannabis&rsquo;s greatest gifts is its remarkable potential for spiritual healing and awakening. In this authoritative guide, editor Stephen Gray and 17 other influential voices of the modern cannabis movement explore the spiritual benefits of cannabis and offer guidance on how to interact with the intelligence of this plant ally, a companion and supporter of humanity for millennia. Exploring cannabis spirituality in practice, Gray&rsquo;s chapters examine dosage, strains, and methods of intake; the use of cannabis to open the creative channels; how to conduct group ceremonies with cannabis; and cautions and counterindications for cannabis use. We hear from Chris Bennett on the religious and ritual use of cannabis from pre-biblical times to the present, Joan Bello on marijuana and the body-mind connection, Dee Dussault on ganja yoga, Kathleen Harrison on humanity&rsquo;s co-evolution with cannabis, and cannabis shaman Hamilton Souther on working with the spirit of cannabis. The contributors explore the spiritual future of this plant ally as well as the ritual use of cannabis by the Rastafarians of Jamaica and the Sadhus of India. The chapters from Brazilian ayahuasca shaman Mariano da Silva and ayahuasca apprentice Francisco present wisdom on comingling the sacramental medicines of cannabis and ayahuasca. <BR> <BR>Revealing the potential of &ldquo;the people&rsquo;s plant&rdquo; to enhance a wide range of spiritual practices, such as meditation, yoga, chanting, visualization, shamanism, spirit work, and explorations with other entheogens, this guide shows how cannabis is an effective ally on the awakening journey, unlocking the receptive energy in us all and helping us to feel connected to nature, to each other, and to ourselves.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>3 <BR><i> <BR>Awakening Principles with Cannabis</i> <BR> <BR>Stephen Gray <BR></b> <BR>Stephen Gray is a teacher and writer on spiritual subjects and sacramental medicines. He has worked extensively with Tibetan Buddhism, the Native American Church, and with entheogenic medicines. The author of <i>Returning to Sacred World: A Spiritual Toolkit for the Emerging Reality</i>, he is also a conference and workshop organizer, leader, and speaker as well as a part-time photographer and music composer under the artist name Keary. He lives in Vancouver, British Columbia. <BR> <BR><b>BASIC SPIRITUAL WORKING PRINCIPLES </b><i> <BR><BR>You can use cannabis as a sacrament--not as an end in itself, but as a holy tool to help you to experience reality. Cannabis opens you up and leaves you compassionate.</i> <BR> --Stephen Gaskin <BR> <BR>Cannabis can be tricky to work with. For many, even most of us, there&rsquo;s a learning curve in finding out how to most skillfully benefit from the plant as a spiritual ally. A number of factors can influence the short and long-term spiritual benefits--dosage, strain, frequency of use, attitude toward the plant, one&rsquo;s state of mind and body at the time of the encounter, the specific setting, and maybe most important, the ability to quiet the discursive mind and allow periods of inner stillness. A teaching from wisdom traditions may help establish ground for how to work with cannabis in spiritually beneficial ways. It&rsquo;s how we work with our thoughts and intentions in formal practices and throughout the daily walk. <BR> <BR>The simple way of saying it is that we create our own reality. But that principle is slippery. Our operating system configurations were almost fully internalized before we were capable of understanding what was being downloaded. Some of it may even have been carried over from previous incarnations. <BR> <BR>The result is that we tend to be driven by narratives operating below the horizon of awareness. The great teachings say that bringing those drives--the unconscious material of what Buddhists term <i>samsara</i>: the confused mind of the unresolved, unhealed ego--into the light of day, ultimately allows us to learn how to function skillfully and gracefully as authentic, awakened beings. <BR> <BR><b>CANNABIS, INTENTION, AND THE CLARIFYING/AMPLIFYING EFFECT</b> <BR> <BR>You may be wondering what all this has to do with the sacred herb as an ally for awakening. When we meet cannabis with intention and focus, its ability to clarify and amplify can both shine a light on the illusions we carry and invite us to release into a deeper, more relaxed, open-hearted presence that feels right and real. As with other entheogenic medicines, it provides the means for a condensed and heightened mindfulness and awareness meditation. <BR> <BR>Intention is a key starting point for that realization. In effective ceremonial environments, like those of the Native American Church for example, entheogenic medicines can dramatically potentiate the manifestation of an intention, and in its own particular way cannabis can do that too when used skillfully. Along with its truth serum, clarifying capability, when you can maintain a degree of non-thought presence, cannabis can assist in bringing about a softening of the armor and a freeing of the heart in compassion. Intentions fueled by love have that much greater potential for manifestation. <BR> <BR><b>CANNABIS AND THE PHYSICAL ORGANISM <BR></b> <BR><i>Physical energy must be mastered and grounded for spiritual energy to move, because physical energy transforms the spirit.</i> <BR> --Teilhard de Chardin <BR> <BR>As well as its clarifying and amplifying qualities, cannabis also works directly on the physical organism, although as Joan Bello so clearly describes it, it&rsquo;s all part of the same activity of the plant. The fresh, oxygen-rich blood that flows into the extremities does its work on the mind <i>and </i>on the body. <BR> <BR>The expansion and release that cannabis can potentiate are likely a significant component of its increasingly well-known healing abilities. It&rsquo;s all interwoven. More and more of us are recognizing that physical and spiritual healing are inseparable. The &ldquo;charged equilibrium&rdquo;--as Joan Bello calls it--and the loosening of muscular structure activated by cannabis when we&rsquo;re present with it <i>is</i> a spiritual awakening process. <BR> <BR>When the body feels good, as it does when energized and relaxed at the same time, well-being increases, even joy. No doubt that&rsquo;s why cannabis is sometimes described as a euphoriant. When mind and body are synchronized you feel good. Feeling good, awake, and connected to your heart <i>is</i> spiritual. <BR><b> <BR>GRADUALLY LESSENING THE "ME" HOLD </b> <BR> <BR>It&rsquo;s possible that the cannabis plant&rsquo;s most significant spiritual benefit, just as it is with other entheogens, is not as much in the immediate experience of the high as it is in what&rsquo;s learned and incorporated--i.e. embodied--for the daily walk. By becoming familiar with a state of well-being in the broadest sense, we&rsquo;re training ourselves to recognize it so that we can tune in and be present in the &ldquo;post-meditation&rdquo; experience. <BR> <BR>In general the more you can let the busy mind dissolve for a while, the more you can directly experience cannabis&rsquo;s mind-body releasing and healing benefits. The less Me, the more cannabis can do its work effectively. <BR> <BR>This is an ongoing practice, an acquired &ldquo;taste.&rdquo; Except in rare, extreme life circumstances, the realignment and rebalancing process takes a long time as we gradually release old patterns and wounds and shift our trust and confidence from the self-protective narratives of the struggling ego to the harmonious flow of awakened heart wisdom. As they say in the Santo Daime ayahuasca teachings, it takes<i> firmeza, coragem, e confia</i>--firmness, courage, and trust.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[Our origins as a slave species and the Anunnaki legacy in our DNA <BR> <BR>&bull; Reveals compelling new archaeological and genetic evidence for the engineered origins of the human species, first proposed by Zecharia Sitchin in The 12th Planet <BR> <BR>&bull; Shows how the Anunnaki created us using pieces of their own DNA, controlling our physical and mental capabilities by inactivating their more advanced DNA <BR> <BR>&bull; Identifies a recently discovered complex of sophisticated ruins in South Africa as the city of the Anunnaki leader Enki <BR> <BR>Scholars have long believed that the first civilization on Earth emerged in Sumer some 6,000 years ago. However, as Michael Tellinger reveals, the Sumerians and Egyptians inherited their knowledge from an earlier civilization that lived at the southern tip of Africa and began with the arrival of the Anunnaki more than 200,000 years ago. Sent to Earth in search of life-saving gold, these ancient Anunnaki astronauts from the planet Nibiru created the first humans as a slave race to mine gold--thus beginning our global traditions of gold obsession, slavery, and god as dominating master. <BR> <BR>Revealing new archaeological and genetic evidence in support of Zecharia Sitchin&rsquo;s revolutionary work with pre-biblical clay tablets, Tellinger shows how the Anunnaki created us using pieces of their own DNA, controlling our physical and mental capabilities by inactivating their more advanced DNA--which explains why less than 3 percent of our DNA is active. He identifies a recently discovered complex of sophisticated ruins in South Africa, complete with thousands of mines, as the city of Anunnaki leader Enki and explains their lost technologies that used the power of sound as a source of energy. Matching key mythologies of the world&rsquo;s religions to the Sumerian clay tablet stories on which they are based, he details the actual events behind these tales of direct physical interactions with &ldquo;god,&rdquo; concluding with the epic flood--a perennial theme of ancient myth--that wiped out the Anunnaki mining operations. <BR> <BR>Tellinger shows that, as humanity awakens to the truth about our origins, we can overcome our programmed animalistic and slave-like nature, tap in to our dormant Anunnaki DNA, and realize the longevity and intelligence of our creators as well as learn the difference between the gods of myth and the true loving God of our universe.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<B>Chapter 14 <BR>Myths and Lies <BR>The Living Gods </B> <BR> <BR>I recall vividly the first day I discovered a story about prehistoric mythological gods and their adventures. It sounded like the world&rsquo;s greatest fairy tale and yet it possessed some kind of mystery that made it feel more real than any other story I had ever heard. The characters were so well defined. Flying through the skies, crossing the world in a flash, causing the thunder and rain, and bringing love and fertility to people while somehow being engaged in a perpetual battle for some righteous cause. It was mainly the Greek, Roman, and Egyptian gods that I was so taken with. Although I was told on many occasions that they were not real, and they were merely imaginary deities who arose out of people&rsquo;s overactive minds over thousands of years, I began to wonder what the possibilities were that maybe somewhere in the distant past such deities actually existed on Earth. But my history teachers were steadfast in their pronouncement that they were just imaginary characters of simple people who needed something to believe in. Those simple, primitive people must have had great imagination, I thought, saddened by the reality that modern man no longer has such a vivid imagination . . . such detailed imagination . . . such convincing imagination, which could last for thousands of years. But in the Western education system, driven relentlessly by Judeo-Christian monotheistic beliefs, any teacher who would carelessly admit to the possible existence of ancient gods would be rapidly dismissed. That little part--which has firmly held our culture in a stranglehold for 2,000 years--I did not know for some time. <BR> <BR>Then one day a small technicality dawned on me: all the great civilizations of the world have their own mythology filled with magnificent gods. It made me wonder how they all heard about these gods. A well informed thirteen-year-old friend of mine provided the answer. &ldquo;People passed the stories down from one generation to another for thousands of years and that is how they spread all over the world,&rdquo; he said convincingly. Of course! That is what people did, they told stories to their children and the stories traveled around the world being told by mothers everywhere. That seemed like a plausible solution to me, and I was satisfied for a while. But as the years went by and I started to delve into more juicy literature, I suddenly wasn&rsquo;t so sure anymore. How is it possible that every civilization around the world had a similar set of gods they prayed to? And the gods did not take thousands of years to reach them; they suddenly appeared out of the blue, taking control of the local humans&rsquo; lives and destinies. This seemed to present a logistical problem. Even today, with international flight, with media covering every corner of the world, it is still difficult to get a message across, which people will accept, swallow, and buy in to. People must be really impressed by something to embrace it, or they must be enticed by the promise of reward, or forced by the threat of violence. It is therefore very difficult to swallow modern-day explanations of how the primitive people of the world all got to hear the stories about these fantastical gods. <BR> <BR>What makes these assumptions even sillier is that the people of ancient times had no idea who lived 200 miles away from them, let alone 10,000 miles away. How could those amazing stories of majestic gods have traveled such distances? And who was telling those stories to the people 11,000 years ago? Who actually created those stories? It gets even more confusing when we realize that all the ancient cultures had very much the same group of gods they prayed to, feared, made offerings to, were protected by, were punished by, and whom they seemed to have regular contact with. If this sounds strange, let me quickly remind you of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and other biblical legends who had exactly those kind of experiences with their god constantly. It was as if the gods were controlling the people&rsquo;s lives on a daily basis in ancient history. Is it possible that the gods of the ancient Mesopotamians and Greeks were the same gods of Noah and Abraham? The many descriptions in the Sumerian tablets by kings and priests of their gods are very similar to the descriptions by the biblical characters of god. Let me also ask, why has it been 2,000 years since god has physically appeared before someone of international stature, or anyone else for that matter, and had a conversation with them? <BR> <BR>The puzzle of the ancient gods is a crucial element in the quest for our origins. Let&rsquo;s face it, the insipid explanations of how the primitive people created these gods from their imagination when they were bored thousands of years ago is not plausible; it stinks of our modern-day arrogance. There are simply too many holes, too many incredible coincidences. The most visible coincidence is that all the ancient cultures had virtually the same gods with the same hierarchy. There is always the supreme god responsible for creating the world, his sons and daughters, and their offspring. And in each case the god was incredibly well profiled. The people knew which aspects of their world each god was responsible for, how the gods looked, what they wore, how they traveled, who they married or had kids with, what they liked and disliked, and what offerings to make to them if they were angry. In most cases people even knew where the god actually lived. <BR> <BR>The gods were powerful with abilities way beyond human comprehension and yet they looked like humans, ate like humans, and displayed the same emotions--love, hate, loyalty, and anger. This amazing similarity has baffled historians and anthropologists for years. Yet the moment we venture beyond our small-minded outlook, we can begin to recognize the genetic link between humans and their gods.]]></d104>

How can I overcome my struggles to meditate more deeply? Is there a need for a guru or can I rely on myself? Can I trust my intuition? Is it possible to hear the &ldquo;Inner Word,&rdquo; the voice of the soul, and how can I be sure that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m hearing? Is the Higher Self in the heart? <BR><BR>Offering trustworthy answers to these and many more questions, renowned spiritual teacher Paul Brunton provides instructions to guide one&rsquo;s development in three fundamental areas of the spiritual path: meditation, self-examination, and the unfolding of awakening. Guiding you with insight and care through each stage of meditation, including advanced states that deepen one&rsquo;s inner life, he explains how meditation is the art and practice of introverting attention, of freeing oneself for a period of time from thoughts, sensations, and feelings and allowing the soul to reveal itself out of the quiet that one has created. He explains the goal of each meditative stage and the obstacles you are likely to face and examines the need for spiritual dependency on any particular guru, teaching, or practice, showing that following your intuition can bring spiritual success. <BR><BR>Exploring the process of self-examination and emotional purification, Brunton shows how life&rsquo;s challenges are moments by which we can make real progress in our surrender to a higher life. He reveals how to break free from the ego, follow your intuition to align with your ideals, and tap into the inspiration flowing from within. He also examines the development of transcendental insight, the cornerstone of compassionate wisdom in action, which allows us to become a source of inspiration to all we encounter. <BR><BR>Including writings received by the Paul Brunton Philosophic Foundation after his death, this guide offers transformative wisdom to aid our understanding of what the spiritual journey entails, help point the way when the way is uncertain, and learn and grow from the challenges that arise as you develop spiritually.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[Chapter 1 <BR><BR>The Adventure of Meditation <BR><BR>The need for solitude and time to cultivate the inner life, in both its metaphysical and mystical phases, is the first imperative. Solitude is needed because the presence of others definitely disturbs the emptying process. Time is needed because the mind is habitually filled with thoughts of the outer world; it is totally essential to empty it of them for a while--regularly, habitually, and deliberately. Without a determined use of willpower it is, however, hard for most people to get solitude or find time. <BR><BR>If the first requirement for solitude develops partly out of the aspirant's need to be able to concentrate thought without interruption, it also develops partly from the restless mental auras that most people carry about with them. They themselves shrink from being alone and naturally introduce an antipathetic influence wherever solitary meditation is being practiced. Perhaps their terror of solitude arises because it makes them conscious of the spiritual aimlessness and intellectual vacuity of their sojourn on earth. The fear of being alone simply means that a man has no inner life at all. The scale of values that lists solitude as a frightful evil to be avoided, or considers the desire for it as an eccentric or even antisocial trait, is materialistic. The mystic who has learned the art of creative solitude can hear a mental voice in its inner silence. Thus for the mystic the loneliness, which is maddening for some, is enlightening. <BR><BR>For the requirement of time, for a certain period each day there must be a separation from all usual physical labors and intellectual activities, a period wherein aspirants can become and remain bodily still and mentally quiet. They must set apart a little time once or twice a day for meditation, just as they set apart some time for eating food. This is indispensable to achieving spiritual progress. It is quite practicable for most people to create a routine that, while satisfying the need of withdrawal for meditation, nevertheless would not interfere with worldly activities and responsibilities. <BR><BR>It is necessary periodically to put aside the things of time so as to seek the timeless, to isolate oneself from the outward world so as to seek an inward one. The psychological purpose of such isolation is to create a new habit and a new attitude. The habit is meditation. The attitude is introversion. Aspirants are led to the hard task of reeducating their powers of perception, understanding, and attention. These powers have to be cultivated through a series of regular exercises. This involves self-training in definite work and a long progressive apprenticeship. Meditation is an art that has to be learned by repeated practice, like the art of playing a piano. It comes naturally to virtually no one. Its technique requires a skill that has to be learned like that of any other art. <BR><BR>Here the habit-forming tendency of the mind can be an excellent aid. Aspirants will gain more by exercises regularly practiced over a period of, say, six months than by the same exercises done in fits and starts over the same period. Consequently, a fixed time of the day should be appointed for them. The ideal rhythm would be to meditate three times a day in coordination with the rhythm of the sun's movements--at dawn, noon, and dusk. But aspirants could not arrive at this all at once. They could best start with a single period and continue with that for months, or even years, until they feel ready to advance and add a second period to it. They will have to work at these two periods, be they dawn and dusk or noon and dusk, for a considerable time before the inner prompting is likely to tell them to take the further step and add the third period. Even then it may not be possible for aspirants always to adhere faithfully to the program thus laid down. Social necessities, for instance, may compel them to leave out some period or other almost every week. Hence, aspirants must do their best within the limits of their personal circumstances. <BR><BR>It will take some time for the mental agitation created by getting immersed in worldly business or personal affairs to subside. Until this happens, the aspirant cannot proceed with the positive work of meditation but rather must engage in the negative task of clearing out those distracting memories. This is one reason why in the East the morning period is recommended for such practice. At the beginning of the day the thoughts and emotions are still undisturbed, hence withdrawal into their center is then easier. Some, however, may find the morning--with its anticipation of activities yet to be started--unattractive for this purpose and may regard the very fatigue of a hard day's work as an inducement to relax in the evening and seek inner peace. <BR><BR>If the regular hour for meditation occasionally proves inconvenient, it may be postponed to a later time. Should this be impossible, the practice may be abandoned for that day. If it is possible to hold enduringly to the full period previously laid down as desirable and available for such exercise, this will help to create an advantageous habit. But if on any particular day the fatigue becomes intolerable, then also it will be better to abandon practice for that day. Aside from these fixed times, or perhaps in displacement of them, the intuitive call to abandon every physical labor and every intellectual activity will recur again and again. Aspirants should obey these calls. In the very midst of business affairs or daily work, aspirants may have sudden lapses into inward abstraction. These will ordinarily be quite brief and definitely should be kept so. But they are worth cultivating wherever and whenever they happen to come. If this is done frequently and faithfully, the power to meditate increases.]]></d104>

Paul Brunton&rsquo;s work demonstrates a real mastery of the intricacies of spiritual life. His sagely conclusions on a number of key topics rarely covered elsewhere in spiritual literature provide an important contribution to our contemporary understanding of awakening and enlightenment. This kind of knowledge is indispensable for the modern seeker, because it provides a clear picture of not only what to expect when going through the process of dis-identifying with form and becoming one with the formless but also how to properly integrate this profound transformation of consciousness into an ordinary human life.

As soon as your soul begins its life experience, a field of energy is released that records every thought, word, action, desire, and emotion. In this guide to opening the Akashic Records, Maureen St. Germain provides precise instructions explaining how to connect with your personal Record Keepers, gain clear access to the Akashic Records, discover information about you and your loved ones, and learn your soul&rsquo;s purpose. <BR><BR>The author explains how outside energies can influence your connection to the Akashic Records. She details energetic clearing exercises to remove the energies blocking or shadowing your access and teaches the Higher Self Protocol to ensure an authentic channel of communication. She explores how to find the Record Keepers who will be the most helpful to you and provides techniques and tools, such as guided energy work, to prepare you for Akashic Record access, initiate you into the 5D mindset, and invite more accuracy and a stronger connection. She details the specific markers to look for to recognize genuine Akashic Librarians and to validate and confirm the information you receive, rather than simply &ldquo;trusting&rdquo; it to be true. She also provides guidance on accessing the Akashic Records on behalf of other people, how to ask questions, and how to handle the information as it comes in. <BR><BR>Explaining why the Ascended Masters opened access to the Akashic Records to all of humanity and how their presence assists you, St. Germain shows how the intended purpose for working with the Akashic Records is for soul growth, not to &ldquo;repair&rdquo; your karma debts. By seeing your records and working with your Record Keepers, not only will you learn your soul&rsquo;s purpose and help solve the problems that crop up in everyday life and relationships, but you will amplify your spirituality and begin operating at a higher level in consciousness. Your work in the Akashic Records aids and assists in Earth&rsquo;s ascension.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[Chapter 7 <BR><BR>Directing Traffic: Handling Information That Comes In <BR><BR><B>Go with What You Get</B> <BR><BR>Sometimes you are taking difficult questions to the Record Keepers. What will they tell you? When you need a breakthrough on some issue or concern, it is always good to pay attention to the signs and signals that show up along the way. Sometimes you will be attracted to a book. Sometimes you will go somewhere and meet someone who has some service or conversation that you need. When you open the Records, you will be stunned to discover the Record Keepers referring to this new information; they direct you to the book you just purchased or the place you needed to be! <BR><BR>There will also be times that you will question what the Record Keepers are telling you. If you doubt their information, you can do a quick check-in with your Higher Self. This helps you trust your skills in the Akashic field. Sometimes you might think you are making it up. In fact that is pretty normal. <BR><BR>Your Record Keepers and Guides can be counted on to help you comprehend more than you can see or understand on your own, thus helping you shift through life&rsquo;s hurdles, harnessing your gifts and magnifying your goodness. <BR><BR><B>Exercise 7:1. More Questions in the Akashic Records <BR></B><BR>&bull; Is my ego/mind or emotions blocking me from understanding? <BR>&bull; What might be blocking me that needs clearing?<BR>&bull; Are there concealed aspects of me that keep me from knowing or understanding the situation? <BR><BR><B>Unexpected Information</B> <BR><BR>You may also be surprised that the Record Keepers have solutions for you that you had no idea were possible because they have never occurred to you. When I received an alarming and intuitive, yet subtle, message about my husband&rsquo;s life being in danger at a job site, I asked him if he had checked in with his Higher Self about returning to the location where the fire had occurred (he is a fire scientist). He said, &ldquo;Well, if YOU told me not to go back, I wouldn&rsquo;t return.&rdquo; I filled in the gruesome details and he asked me to open his Akashic Records. I figured he would want to know things such as whether or not it was &ldquo;his time to go&rdquo; or if certain factors could be mitigated. <BR><BR>He completely took me by surprise by instead asking, &ldquo;What caused the fire?&rdquo; He&rsquo;d been on this investigation for over three months, and I knew no details. Through me, the Record Keepers said, &ldquo;It was to cover up a couple of murders.&rdquo; I was so shocked with this response, that I pulled myself out of the energy of the Akashics, looked at him and said, &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s strange, no one died in this fire.&rdquo; Frankly I was really embarrassed, thinking that I had somehow given him false information! He looked at me gravely and said, &ldquo;Actually three people died.&rdquo; It was then I learned that he could find no &ldquo;accidental source&rdquo; for the fire to have occurred, and his pointed question was answered directly in the Records. <BR><BR>Sometimes you will ask the Record Keepers and Guides something and then not get anything. This usually means there is a block that keeps information from coming through. When this happens, be sure to use the prayer to clear blocks. <BR><BR><B>Clearing Work<BR></B><BR>Also be sure to do your clearing work on yourself. Learn how to clear others, especially how to clear remotely. This is very useful when you are working with clients and they need clearing. Many have written about this. I wrote a small concise guide, Reweaving the Fabric of Your Reality. Even though you might not think you have any entities or dark energies that might prevent you from connecting with the Akashic Guides or healing yourself--when you do the clearing work, you discover that you suddenly feel better and have the channel open to the Records again.<BR><BR>There are also other reasons why you might not get good information for a client, or get clarity that you are seeking. You may have lost soul parts that need to be reclaimed and returned to you. People often break off parts of themselves during a traumatic event in order to feel &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; They can be fragmented from situations and occurrences of past life dramas. Soul Retrieval work can help you bring back your damaged and lost parts, gently and easily by you. Use the Unify, A Soul Retrieval Meditation along with the AroMandalas Unity were created for a person to perform soul retrieval for themselves by themselves. It is available as an MP3 package with detailed instructions on my website. <BR><BR><B>Exercise 7:2. What Is the Difference between Wonder and Why? <BR></B><BR>When you ask your Higher Self, &ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s going on&rdquo; or &ldquo;I wonder why that happened,&rdquo; you have opened the window to receiving full information. When you just ask why it is, this is so your ego can compartmentalize the answer. &ldquo;Why&rdquo; questions are to satisfy the ego/mind. &ldquo;Wonder&rdquo; is open-ended, which invites the Record Keepers to provide insight and understanding. <BR><BR>&bull;What is the meaning of wonder? <BR>&bull;What is the meaning of why? <BR>&bull;How do I stay in my joy? <BR>&bull;What is the most important thing I may learn from a stranger that I met recently? <BR>&bull;Pick a fun experience or occurrence that happened this week and ask, &ldquo;What may I know about this event?&rdquo; <BR>&bull;Pick an intense/difficult experience or occurrence that happened this week and ask, &ldquo;What may I know about this event?&rdquo;]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<I>&ldquo;Opening the Akashic Records</I> is very likely the clearest, most thorough, and useful book ever published on this subject. As one who has benefited from readings by skilled practitioners, I can vouch firsthand for the value that insight into the Akashic field, with the help of an experienced guide, can provide. The Akasha can answer any question of consequence, posed with respect; can help us solve issues of health, love, money, and creativity; and can cleanse our cellular memory of guilt, fear, and pain, lifting us into new states of clarified perception and freedom. What makes this book unique, and much needed now, is that it shows you, provided you have the discipline and will stick with the 45-day program, how you can prepare to access your own Akashic Record and then use the richness of empowered serenity that the Akasha will deliver to explore your choice of possible futures. Good luck on this exciting journey!&rdquo;]]></d104>

Working to decrypt these maps, Daniel J. Duke--the great-great-grandson of Jesse James--reveals hidden treasures yet to be recovered as well as connections between the infamous train robber and Freemasonry, the Knights Templar, the Founding Fathers, and Jewish mysticism. <BR><BR>The author explains how Jesse James faked his death and lived out his final years under the name James L. Courtney. He uncovers James&rsquo; affiliation with the Knights of the Golden Circle, a secret society that buried Confederate gold across the United States, and shows how the hidden treasures coded into James&rsquo; maps were not affiliated with the KGC but with the Freemasons, the Knights Templar, and the treasure of the Temple Mount. Using sacred geometry, gematria, and the Kabbalistic Tree of Life symbol, the author explains the encoded map technique used by the Freemasons to hide and later recover treasures, an esoteric template known as the &ldquo;Veil&rdquo;. He shows how the Veil template confirms the locations of Jesse James&rsquo; recovered treasures in Texas as well as other suspected treasure locations, such as the Oak Island Money Pit and Victorio Peak in New Mexico. <BR><BR>Tracing knowledge of the Veil template back through the centuries, the author reveals the Veil hidden on the cover of a 16th-century book that contains a secret map of the New World and the &ldquo;hooked X&rdquo; symbol of the Knights Templar. He shows how the template was used not only to hide treasures but also sacred knowledge and relics, such as within the Bruton Vault, which originally contained secrets tied to Francis Bacon, the Freemasons, the Rosicrucians, and the founding of the United States. Applying the Veil template alongside the esoteric secrets of Poussin&rsquo;s famous painting, <I>Et In Arcadia Ego</I>, and Cassini&rsquo;s Celestial Globe, Duke shows how the template reveals other Templar and Freemason treasure sites scattered throughout America and around the world.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<B>Chapter 4. Connecting the Dots</B> <BR><BR>Shortly after my mother&rsquo;s book on Jesse James came out, we were contacted by many people armed with stories of Jesse James, treasure, or sometimes both. Most of the treasure stories, after a little research, turn out to be tall tales, but there are a few that turned out to be true. <BR><BR>One of those true stories came from a man by the name of George Roming from El Paso, Texas. George Roming, a 32&#176; Freemason, Shriner, and World War II veteran, was born in 1920, not far from where Jesse James aka James Lafayette Courtney lived in the small and rural farming community of Buttermilk, Texas; later renamed Blevins. As a young boy and later a teenager, George would walk past Jesse&rsquo;s farm and when Jesse saw him, he would invite him to sit on the front porch and talk for a while. They got to know one another and Jesse trusted him. In the 1930s, Jesse had George swear an oath of secrecy and hired George to help him move 700 bars of gold. He said they transported the gold in a large wagon to a ranch owned by one of Jesse&rsquo;s friends, approximately twenty miles away. They buried the gold in a rectangular shaped field. They found the center of the field and from that center, Jesse paced forty steps to the north and instructed them to dig a hole approximately eight feet in depth. They lined the bottom of the hole with large timbers, unloaded the gold into the hole, covered it up and left. George drew a map for us on a piece of brown paper and described to us exactly where they buried the gold. The place he described is now under a lake which was created in 1954 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. When I informed George that it is now covered by Lake Belton, he gritted his teeth, looked down and shook his head in disappointment. George Roming died in 2007 at the age of 86. He was a good man and a good friend.<BR><BR>A little more than a year after we met George Roming, we were contacted by Nita Callahan. Ms. Callahan was associated with former Texas State Attorney General, Waggoner Carr, and she wanted to show us the locations of two treasures that had been recovered. The first site was located approximately 2.5 miles west of the Williamson County, Texas, courthouse located in Georgetown, Texas. It was said to have held a very large cache of gold bars weighing close to eighty pounds each. When I returned home I pulled out the maps and started drawing lines. As I stated before, the line from Victorio Peak to the Bruton Parish Church is 1,715 miles long. I then drew a line from Victorio Peak to the site near Georgetown, Texas. That line is 548 miles long and the angle off the main line (the line from Victorio Peak to the Bruton Parish Church) is 33&#176;. Not only is the number 33 associated with Freemasonry but it also happens to be the number of Bacon, as in Francis Bacon, when using gematria along with the alphabet of his time, the Elizabethan alphabet. The second site Ms. Callahan showed us was located to the northeast on a property next to a cemetery almost 1 mile south/southwest of the main intersection in Little River-Academy, Texas. While the treasure that used to be located on this site was smaller than the one in Georgetown, it was said to have been worth millions of dollars in gold alone. We were told that a railroad track was laid there and used to unload the treasure into an underground vault. The remains of the track were clearly visible and the earth around the location of the recovered treasure was marked by a large depression. Although the treasures had long since been recovered, knowing the locations provided valuable information which could possibly help in locating the treasure indicated in my great, great grandfather&rsquo;s (Jesse James&rsquo;s) map. <BR><BR>Each time I learned of a treasure site I would plot the location on a map and work with the Knight of the Golden Circle template to see if it fit or not. It was not until just over a year later, when I learned of yet another treasure site, that it all started to fall into place. This alleged treasure site is located on the outskirts of the small town of Tow, Texas, located on the eastern side of Llano County, near where the Colorado River runs into Lake Buchannan. One of the stories connected with this treasure is that a mule train carrying a government payroll was ambushed and the gold was brought to this location and deposited. It is said to be &ldquo;booby trapped&rdquo; with a water trap; the water being provided by the nearby Colorado River.<BR><BR>Now, in addition to the Victorio Peak and Bruton Vault sites, I had four treasure sites in Texas to work with. If the sites are connected, then what is the connection shared by my great, great grandfather Jesse James (aka James Lafayette Courtney), Albert Pike, Francis Bacon, and the Spanish? If they are connected, then there must be a common link. The only answers I had-- and even thinking it felt as if I were going way out on a limb--was Freemasonry.<BR><BR>If Freemasons were responsible for burying these treasures, then the next obvious question would have to be why? What purpose could they or anyone else have for burying so much wealth? Looking back through history we can find many examples of why someone or some group with so much wealth would feel the need to bury it for safe keeping. One such example of a group with great wealth one day and almost completely wiped out the next is the Knights Templar.]]></d104>

The Bible mentions no witnesses to Moses&rsquo; death, no funeral, and no indication of his burial place, and the story of Exodus paints a very contradictory picture of this man so important to both Judaism and Christianity. At times, he is depicted as a meek, stuttering figure and at others his tyrannical commands and fits of rage terrorize the children of Israel. And, for the last years of his life, he chose to hide behind a veil. What is the explanation for these extreme shifts in character? Was Moses mentally ill? As Rand and Rose Flem-Ath reveal, the evidence points to something much more sinister: Moses was murdered and replaced by an impostor. <BR><BR>The result of a decade-long investigation, this book continues and builds upon the research of Goethe, Christopher Marlowe, and Sigmund Freud--who spent the last 40 years of his life obsessed with solving Moses&rsquo; murder--and reaches a startling but well-evidenced conclusion that Moses was deceived and murdered by his father-in-law, Reuel. The authors show how Reuel was a skilled magician trained at Egypt&rsquo;s prestigious House of Life and they reveal his motive: He was the son of Esau, from whom Jacob stole his birthright, the leadership of the Hebrew people, a role that Moses was now assuming. <BR><BR>The authors explain how the magician Reuel used his sophisticated skills of manipulation and illusion to fake the Burning Bush that spoke to Moses as well as conceal his assumption of Moses&rsquo; identity after the murder. They reveal how the early scribes of the Old Testament inserted lags of time into the Exodus story to cover Moses&rsquo; assassination and replacement, fabricated Moses&rsquo; origin story, and changed the location of the &ldquo;Mountain of God&rdquo; from Edom, where Reuel was a prince, to Sinai. <BR><BR>Unveiling the enigma of Moses&rsquo; real story--and his murder and replacement--the Flem-Aths dramatically challenge the time line and details of biblical history, exposing a cover-up at the very origins of Western religion.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<B>Chapter 1. An Unlaid Ghost</B> <BR><BR>The name Moses is so familiar that we&rsquo;ve forgotten that the word held an unfamiliar and foreign ring to the ancient Hebrews. In the Egyptian language Moses meant son of. It was always, without exception, added to another name--usually that of a god such as Thoth or Ra. Although easily understanding a name like Ra-Moses, which would translate as son of the god Ra, the single name Moses would have been puzzling and would naturally elicit the question, &ldquo;son of whom?&rdquo; To Freud the name strongly indicated that Moses&rsquo; parents were Egyptian and not Hebrew. In <I>Moses and Monotheism</I> he wrote, &ldquo;It might have been expected that one of the many authors who recognized Moses to be an Egyptian name would have drawn the conclusion, or at least considered the possibility, that the bearer of an Egyptian name was himself an Egyptian. In modern times we have no misgivings in drawing such conclusions . . . What hindered them from doing so can only be guessed at. Perhaps the awe of Biblical tradition was insuperable. Perhaps it seemed monstrous to imagine that the man Moses could have been anything other than a Hebrew.&rdquo;<BR><BR>The second chapter of Exodus reveals that Moses was born in Egypt during the reign of a tyrannical Pharaoh who planned to kill all first born Hebrew sons. Moses&rsquo; frantic mother managed to hide him for three months.<BR><BR>Freud claimed that Moses&rsquo; true heritage had been deliberately suppressed by Jewish editors of the Bible who couldn&rsquo;t stomach the idea of such an authoritative prophet not being born to a Jewish mother. He believed that exiled Jewish scholars had invented a more palatable legend during their captivity in Babylon where they had most certainly read the legend of Sargon and were inspired to adopt it for their own propaganda purposes. By a simple cut-and-paste job they conferred upon their hero a fully Hebrew birthright more fitting of the great prophet. In a second article for <I>Imago</I>, Freud took his idea much further, arguing not only that Moses was a full-blooded Egyptian but also, shockingly, that he was a follower of the Eighteenth Dynasty Pharaoh, Akhenaten (1375 BC-1358 BC) who introduced the world&rsquo;s first religion based upon the idea of a single God. <BR><BR>In 1819, Johann Goethe wrote &ldquo;Israel in the Desert&rdquo; partly as an attempt to show how later editors of the Bible had tampered with the story of Moses. At the time, many biblical scholars were busy trying to disentangle the various strands that composed the first five books of the Old Testament attributed to Moses and named The Torah (the Law) by the Jews. Goethe was disturbed by what he saw as the deliberate insertion of artificial laws into the text that only impeded the progress of the stories. He believed that the narrative of the heroic adventure had been bogged down by unnecessary, and unwelcome, depictions of religious ritual.30 <BR><BR>Goethe&rsquo;s aesthetic convinced him that misleading words had been added to the scriptures. Like an art historian peeling away the layers of paint covering a lost masterpiece he revealed hidden seams and overlapping pigments that implied that there were different authors, some of whom were obsessed with religious ceremony. According to Goethe these late, bogus and unwelcome additions spoiled the natural flow of the stories. <BR><BR>The same meddlesome writers had exaggerated critical timescales. Goethe considered the idea that a great prophet had wandered the desert for forty years with thousands of people in tow to be absurd. It called into question Moses&rsquo; fitness as a commander and painted him in a ridiculous light. Goethe concluded that the only explanation must be that the forty years was symbolic; noting other instances in the Bible where the number forty was used symbolically. Remove the corruption of the text, especially the illegitimate timescale, Goethe reasoned, and Moses&rsquo; dignity would be restored, revealing the prophet of God as more of a hero and less of a buffoon.<BR><BR><B>Cold Case File</B> <BR><BR>When there are no witnesses to a murder, detectives are trained to discover the guilty party by asking who had the &ldquo;motive, means and opportunity&rdquo; to commit the crime. There is only one character in the Moses story who fits this bill. The insights of Marlowe, Goethe, and Freud all provide clues to his identity and point to evidence of his ruthlessness. <BR><BR>Marlowe gave us the &lsquo;means,&rsquo; by which the murder was accomplished. He believed that Moses was an illusionist whose acts thrilled and baffled the children of Israel because they were naive in the ways of an Egyptian-trained Magician. These acts of illusion concealed the murder of the prophet and allowed an impostor to step into his place. Goethe believed that the story of Moses had been tampered with by scribes with a powerful agenda. Their late editing of the original spoken stories distorted the truth by inserting artificially long periods of time into the text. Removing these exaggerated periods of time reveals what was concealed. We take Goethe&rsquo;s argument further. Once we remove the artificial timescales that were shoe-horned into the text by the manipulative editors it becomes apparent that our prime suspect had the perfect opportunity to murder Moses. <BR><BR>Freud insisted that Moses was an Egyptian. Denying the Jews a genetic link to the greatest of their prophets was something he did with great reluctance, especially since his people were facing the Nazis in 1939, the year his book was released. The idea that there were two Moses was something many of the faithful found deeply disturbing.<BR><BR>Unlike Freud we don&rsquo;t believe that the death of the &lsquo;first&rsquo; Moses resulted from a spontaneous murder. One man was powerfully motivated, possessed the skills of a magician, and had the opportunity to murder Moses. Our suspect is Moses&rsquo; father-in-law, Reuel, the man Goethe held in such esteem.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[&ldquo;Talk about a cold-case murder getting hot new attention! Rand and Rose Flem-Ath bring some first-class detective work to bear on one of the most important, albeit lost, stories of Western civilization, and they come to some shattering conclusions. Long ignored by mainstream academic scholarship, the extraordinary views of the father of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, on the identity and fate of the Hebrew lawgiver Moses finally get some richly deserved attention. In a dramatic tale of wartime danger and personal hardship suffered by Freud and his family, the Flem-Aths offer a rare glimpse into his little-known quest to track down the details of a sensational and controversial hypothesis that he knew might get him cast out of his own community, if not killed. The result is riveting and the book is a true page-turner.&rdquo;]]></d104>

We are evolutionarily designed to fast, and the body knows how to do it very well. Fasting allows the body and all its systems to rest, purify, and heal. During a fast, the body enters the same cleansing and healing cycle it normally enters during sleep. As a fast progresses, the body consumes everything that is not essential to bodily functioning--including bacteria, viruses, fibroid tumors, waste products in the blood, buildup around the joints, and stored fat--and the mind and heart release their toxic buildup as well. As Stephen Harrod Buhner reveals, in order to be truly transformed, you must first empty yourself. <BR> <BR>Offering step-by-step guidelines to fully prepare yourself for a deep fast, Buhner explores what to expect during and after spiritual, emotional, and physical fasting and detoxification. He details the necessary dietary and mental preparations leading up to your fast, what you can and can&rsquo;t do during a fast, and how to end your fast. He also explains how to plan the length of your fast and how to choose between a water fast, a juice fast, or a mono-diet fast. Revealing how fasting can help or heal many chronic conditions, such as type II diabetes, childhood seizures, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, psoriasis, insomnia, and fibromyalgia, Buhner shows fasting as a way to truly inhabit the body, to experience its sacredness, and to activate its deep capabilities for self-healing.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<B>Chapter 5 <BR>Preparing for the Fast, Fasting, Breaking the Fast </B> <BR> <BR>Fasting is more than anything an engagement with personal mortality and the rebirth that follows such an engagement. When we decide to fast we decide to examine our own relationship with survival, and this means directly encountering death. These are heady topics, and one reason that fasting should be undertaken with consciousness and deep thought. In any engagement with our own death we have the opportunity to deeply examine our lives, to explore what we have done and not done, and to decide what we wish to do in the future. We have the opportunity to revise or alter the path we have taken, to make new choices, to begin anew. <BR> <BR>DETERMINE IF YOU ARE READY FOR A FAST <BR> <BR>Initially, the most important thing to consider is why you want to fast. You should fast because you want to, not because a voice in your head is telling you that you will be better for it, more whole, cleaner, purer, or more spiritual. Fasting should be done because some deep part of your self lets you know that it is something you need to do to be who you are, who you want to be. The decision to fast often begins in a deep, unconscious part of the soul. Eventually, if we are smart, we begin to listen, to think, and to begin to prepare ourselves for a journey. Like all journeys, fasting takes preparation--preparation of the soul, the emotions, the body. The more conscious you are about what you are doing, the better prepared you will be and the more you will get from it. <BR> <BR>CHOOSE YOUR FAST <BR> <BR>When you decide you are ready to fast, think about what kind of fast you want to do. Know also that the older you are, the more intense a fast can be, especially if you have been living a toxic lifestyle for a very long time. If you have never fasted before or if it has been a very long time since you have fasted, you should consider a juice fast. While a juice fast will, like a water fast, bring many benefits and will evoke many deep emotional, spiritual, and physical insights, it is much easier. A juice fast is the best way to first experience fasting. If you have fasted before or if you are working with an experienced fasting coach or health practitioner, then perhaps you will want to do a deep water fast. A water fast will be much more demanding; the degree of emotional, physical, and spiritual intensity is much higher. The benefits are correspondingly greater, but only if you are ready for it and are not forcing yourself into it too quickly. While a water fast is exceptionally safe, if you engage in a water fast before you are ready to do so, you risk doing yourself spiritual, emotional, and physical violence. Neither fast is better or worse than the other, they just do different things. Each type of fast will make different demands on you; both are of great benefit. <BR> <BR>DECIDE HOW LONG YOU ARE GOING TO FAST <BR> <BR>It is crucial to decide for how long you are going to fast before you begin. The part of you that wants to eat will feel more taken care of if it knows just how long you will be fasting. It is important as well that you keep your word to yourself and only fast just this long. If you are new to fasting, start with a short fast and let yourself get used to the process. Use the following guidelines to help you determine the length of time you should fast. <BR> <BR><B>Fasting Time Guidelines <BR>Water Fasting</B> <BR> <BR>Regular Diet <BR>2 weeks (minimum) low-fat cleansing diet <BR>3 days fresh juices and herbal teas only <BR>4-10 days water only <BR>1-3 days fresh fruit juices; miso soup; mild, heavily steamed vegetables <BR>4-14 days low-fat cleansing diet <BR>Regular diet <BR> <BR>The length of time spent on each of these sections depends on a person&rsquo;s physical, emotional, and spiritual condition and needs. <BR> <BR><B>Juice Fasting</B> <BR> <BR>Regular Diet <BR>2 weeks (minimum) low-fat cleansing diet <BR>4-30 days fresh juices and herbal teas only <BR>1 day miso soup and mild, heavily steamed vegetables <BR>4-14 days low-fat cleansing diet <BR>Regular diet <BR> <BR>The length of time spent on each of these sections depends on a person&rsquo;s physical, emotional, and spiritual condition and needs. <BR> <BR>SET YOUR PHYSICAL GOALS FOR THE FAST <BR>Consider these questions before you set your physical goals. <BR> <BR>1. Do you believe your body can be healthy? <BR>2. Do you believe your body has an innate wisdom that can guide it where it needs to go? <BR>3. Do you have any beliefs about your body that may stand in the way of it becoming healthy? <BR>4. Are there any illnesses that have been troubling you that you would like to see resolved? <BR>5. Do you think it is possible to be healthy long into old age? <BR>6. Can you conceive of your body as sacred? <BR> <BR>Think deeply about any truths that underlie these questions. Once you have thought deeply about these questions, then, and only then, decide what your physical goals are for your fast. These goals are more supportive if they are of the order of things like: I want my body to feel healthier than before the fast. I want to love my body more. I want to be healed in this area of my body. <BR> <BR>Most of us are trained out of perceiving our bodies as holy, trained instead to see our bodies in distorted and misguided ways, even to believe they have our worst interests at heart. When you begin the difficult task of ceasing hostilities with your body, you directly confront the most basic beliefs you have been given about your physical self. It is one of the most loving and most powerful acts of courage and faith that you can do. <BR> <BR><I>A genuine fast cleanses body, mind, and soul.</I> <BR>--Gandhi]]></d104>

She outlines the basic principles of Ayurveda, including pulse diagnosis, a key tool for early detection, and explains the successful treatment protocols she has developed over more than 30 years of Ayurvedic practice. She details the underlying reasons for thyroid malfunction, such as inflammation, malnutrition, and toxins, and how the thyroid is connected with the health of the rest of body, including the liver and gall bladder. She explores the Ayurvedic treatment of thyroid-related conditions, such as Hashimoto&rsquo;s thyroiditis, hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism, offering guidance on the targeted use of herbs, specific dietary recommendations, proper detoxification, and Ayurvedic recipes. She also includes treatments and remedies for common symptoms of thyroid disease, including insomnia, depression, fatigue, and osteoporosis, as well as for luxurious hair growth and weight loss. <BR><BR>Based on the treatment of thousands of patients, this book also shares success stories of thyroid healing and the scientific studies that support the author&rsquo;s Ayurvedic thyroid protocols. Offering an easy-to-follow yet comprehensive guide, Teitelbaum shows that optimum thyroid health as well as overall health are within everyone&rsquo;s reach.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[Chapter 3 <BR><BR>The Doshas, Diet, Toxins, and the Health of the Thyroid <BR><BR>The thyroid gland is like a very delicate flower that needs to be watered daily and meticulously cared for. If there is any problem anywhere in the body, whether it comes from lack of nourishment, electromagnetic exposure, infections, an overload of stress or toxins, this little flower will wilt, taking your physiology down with it. <BR><BR>On the brighter side, however, if you just give a little more attention to your body--resting, nourishing, and detoxifying it--your thyroid gland will bounce right back, giving you the glowing health and metabolism you long for. This is one of the reasons why we can&rsquo;t devote all our therapies to just the thyroid gland--every problem throughout the whole body is tugging away at this gland, so in order to improve its function, the health of the whole body needs to be addressed. Ignoring these underlying problems and just supporting the thyroid gland is a treatment option that is bound to fail. <BR><BR><B>Doshic Imbalance at the Root of all Thyroid Disorders</B> <BR><BR>Ayurveda prides itself on identifying imbalances at the deepest level. Before we unfold the numerous causes of thyroid dysfunction, it is imperative to understand that behind everything we see, whether it is low or high hormones, whatever the symptoms may be--hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, Hashimoto&rsquo;s, Grave&rsquo;s Disease, even thyroid cancer--we must first consider balancing the three doshas. This is usually the first step in tackling any thyroid symptom, whether hair loss, arrhythmias, weight gain, depression, or fatigue. Don&rsquo;t be tempted to treat all these symptoms without addressing their root causes. If you treat the symptoms without balancing the three doshas, your results will be minimal and temporary. <BR><BR><I>Review of the Three Doshas</I> <BR><BR>The three doshas are vata, pitta, and kapha. The ancient doctors always liked to trace health problems back to these elements, which, if out of balance, were considered the very first steps in a gradual decline in one&rsquo;s health. Therefore, it is imperative that you begin your search here when looking for the root of your symptoms. <BR><BR>These three doshas comprise the five elements found in nature: space, air, fire, water, and earth. Since humans are a microcosm of nature, these five basic elements--present in all matter--also exist within each of us. These elemental principles control all our bodily functions, and it is up to us to keep them balanced. But to do that, you must first understand exactly what they are and how they affect your body: <BR><BR><B>Vata </B>represents the elements of space and air. Its qualities are quick, light, cold, dry, rough, subtle, mobile, erratic, dispersing. <BR><BR><B>Pitta</B> represents the elements of fire and water. Its qualities are light, hot, oily, sharp, liquid, sour, pungent. <BR><BR><B>Kapha</B> represents the elements of earth and water. Its qualities are heavy, cold, oily, slow, slimy, dense, soft, static, sweet. <BR><BR>We are all born with differing amounts of these three doshas. Thus, there are different body types. The various combinations could be: Pure Vata, Pure Pitta, Pure Kapha, or combinations of Vata-Pitta, Pitta-Vata, Pitta-Kapha, Vata-Kapha, Kapha-Vata, Kapha-Pitta or all three balanced, Vata-Pitta-Kapha. These represent the amounts of all three doshas you were born with. However, these elements will change as various influences in the environment and other stressors throw your body out of balance. Your current imbalances can be diagnosed through the pulse and by various characteristics of the patient&rsquo;s appearance and symptoms. <BR><BR>Vata is the element of coldness, causing cold hands and feet when imbalanced. It is also quick, representing the element of movement, thus you can become restless and scattered, endlessly talking and moving, making it difficult to stay focused. Light by nature, vata can translate to light sleep, or a tendency for insomnia as your nervous system cannot settle down. Vata is rough and dry, so you may notice rough and dry hair, skin, and nails. <BR><BR>Vata tends to emaciate the body&rsquo;s tissues, causing osteoporosis, weight loss, or thinning hair. Imbalanced vata moves thoughts quickly through the mind, so you can absorb information quickly and then forget it quickly. Because your physiology is running fast you can become fatigued as the body cannot keep up with the fast-moving pace you force your it to undergo every day. Are you noticing yet that many of these symptoms are also characteristics of thyroid imbalance? <BR><BR>A good rule of thumb to keep the doshas balanced is to do the opposite of the aggravated dosha to bring it back into balance. So, a vata type must learn to slow down; get proper rest; eat warm, cooked unctuous foods; stay warm; and resist the temptation to go to bed late, work too hard, or exercise too much. <BR><BR>Throughout the thirty years of my practice, I have noticed hundreds of instances of vata types contributing to their thyroid problems by weakening their endocrine systems through incessant talking and boundless activity--which are on full display when they visit my office. This is a recipe for adrenal burnout and is the first step toward thyroid weakness. The endocrine glands cannot handle this amount of intense activity. The adrenals and thyroid glands are the batteries we run on. They can become depleted and in need of a recharge, accomplished through proper rest, nourishing diet, and early bedtime. In the early stages, vata aggravation and hyperactivity can push the thyroid gland into a hyperthyroid (or overactive) state. But over time the gland will fatigue and become hypothyroid (or underactive) and unable to produce enough hormones. <BR><BR>Vata aggravation can weaken not only the thyroid gland and the whole endocrine system but also the seven dhatus (the seven tissues in the body according to Ayurveda: blood plasma, blood, muscle, fat, bone, bone marrow, and reproductive fluids). <BR><BR>If you can fully understand what vata is and how imbalancing it can affect your thyroid gland, then any treatments you undertake will work more effectively if, at the same time, you learn to balance the disturbed vata.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[A new edition of the classic practical manual for utilizing the chakra system as a body/mind interface for effective energetic healing <BR><BR>&bull; Explores the physical body as a mirror of our consciousness, with symptoms reflecting inner stresses in our emotional being, our mind, and/or our higher self <BR><BR>&bull; Offers an in-depth explanation of different aspects of each chakra, alongside a chakra meditation and practical energy exercises <BR><BR>&bull; Includes color reference charts of the chakras and their associated vibrations, systems, layers of the aura, senses, and areas of consciousness <BR><BR>Drawing on his own profound healing experience as a young man, Martin Brofman developed a system of healing that effectively and seamlessly blends Western psychology and Eastern philosophies: the Body Mirror System. He explains how the chakra system connects to both mind and body to form a body/mind interface, allowing us to read the physical body as a mirror of the consciousness within, track the route from symptom to cause, and then work on releasing the causes on all levels. <BR><BR>Brofman shows how specific tensions or symptoms on the physical level reflect corresponding tensions in one&rsquo;s consciousness about specific issues in life--the inner cause to the outer symptom. The author explains how healing the symptom needs to involve not only releasing the tension on the physical level, but also letting go of the stressful way of interacting with the environment. Thus, the process of healing always implies a process of transformation. <BR><BR>Within the concepts of his Body Mirror System, Brofman explores the chakras and their role in the body, including their associated vibrations, parts of the body, senses, layers of the aura, and areas of consciousness. He explains how to clear and connect the chakras, how to connect to the cosmos through the chakras, and how engaging with thought forms, time travel, and past lives can assist in healing sessions. Discussing the healing of others as well as self-healing, Brofman describes how to heal with chakras, thought forms, white light, and love, and how to perform distance healing. He provides practical energy exercises and chakra meditations, allowing the reader to imminently experience the healing energy in their bodies and prepare for a healing session. He also includes color reference guides, such as a chakra healing chart. <BR><BR>Deeply examining the multilayered elements of the healing process, including transformation, this classic healing guide serves as a practical introduction to energy healing as well as a healer&rsquo;s tutorial and reference book.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<B>Chapter 17. Healing with White Light <BR></B><BR>Here, you as the healer will use White Light as the model of wholeness, or wellness, to create the perception that the healing has happened. When you have imagined that the subject is filled with White Light, that will trigger the perception that the subject is healed. <BR><BR>White Light is used for healing because of all of its positive associations with purity and spirituality. In addition, White Light represents wholeness because it contains all of the colors of the spectrum. Wholeness is wellness. When we think of a fluorescent tube, we see that when the energy flows through the tube, it glows. Then, White Light can also represent energy flowing freely, which fits well with our definition of healing as returning to the experience of wellness through release of blockages. <BR><BR>If White Light represents energy flowing freely, then energy not flowing freely is represented as shadows. When the subject is being filled with White Light, if shadows are seen, you should know that these simply represent tensions, and that more White Light should be shone on them. When light meets shadow, all that remains is light. The tensions were those that existed either in the consciousness or the physical body, or both. The shadows dissolving show the tensions dissolving. <BR><BR>Of course, then, if you feel tensions in the subject&rsquo;s body (in the shoulders, for example), or you know that there are tensions within the subject&rsquo;s body, you will also know that when you look inside, you are going to see the tensions as shadows. If you do not, you must adjust your perceptions until they are in accord with what you know to be true on the physical level. Then, starting with that, the shadows can be dissolved and the tensions released, and the healing can manifest. <BR><BR><I><B>White Light Healing Practice</B></I> <BR><BR>In the classic White Light healing, see that the subject is seated comfortably, feet flat on the floor, hands open and relaxed in the lap, and eyes closed. Naturally, the subject will not be wearing eyeglasses or other prosthetic devices. Then, seeing that the subject is open and ready for their healing, you can begin with the Healing Starting Position, described in Section V. <BR><BR>Feeling the energy in your hands, you know that you are in the ideal state of consciousness in which to feel energy, and in which a healing can happen. Then, decide that what you feel is White Light radiating from your hands. <BR><BR>Gently place your hands on the subject&rsquo;s shoulders. While it is not necessary to the process of healing, touching the subject does provide a feeling of reassurance to the subject, and also opens certain levels of direct communication between you and the subject. The sense of touch, is associated with the Green Chakra (the Heart Chakra), and the aspect of relating to the person inside the body. The shoulders are related to the Blue Chakra, which is involved with the subject&rsquo;s willingness to be open and receive. Thus, when you place your hands on the subject&rsquo;s shoulders, you can have a direct sense of the degree of the subject&rsquo;s openness to the healing. It is emphasized here that the touch is light, and that there is no pressure, and no physical manipulation involved in this type of healing. <BR><BR>When your hands are glowing with White Light, imagine that you are filling the subject with this light, through the shoulders, up into the head, and then down through the body to the toes, also filling the body and the arms out to the skin. This can all be done with your hands resting on the subject&rsquo;s shoulders. <BR><BR>If you sense that it is difficult to enter the body and (therefore) the consciousness of the subject, communicate this silently, spirit to spirit, to the subject. It is like an imaginary conversation which says something like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here for your healing, but I&rsquo;m having difficulty coming inside. Will you please open so that I can help you in the way I know how?&rdquo; Usually, after that, the flow is easier. If it isn&rsquo;t, make the communication aloud. If there is still resistance, acknowledge that, and let the subject know that they need to work with another healer, or in another way, or at another time.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[An exploration of the origins, influences, and legacy of the scandalous Hell-Fire Clubs of the 18th century and beyond <BR><BR>&bull; Reveals the club&rsquo;s origins in the work of Rabelais and the magical practices of John Dee and how their motto, &ldquo;Do What You Will,&rdquo; deeply influenced Aleister Crowley <BR><BR>&bull; Explores the cross-fertilization of liberty and libertinage within these clubs that influenced both U.S. and French Revolutions <BR><BR>&bull; Examines the debaucherous activities and famous members of many Hell-Fire Clubs, including Sir Francis Dashwood&rsquo;s Monks of Medmenham <BR><BR>Mention the Hell-Fire Clubs and you conjure up an image of aristocratic rakes cutting a swath through the village maidens. Which is true, but not the whole truth. The activities of these clubs of upper-class Englishmen revolved around not only debauchery but also blasphemy, ritual, quasi-magical pursuits, and political intrigue. <BR><BR>Providing a history of these infamous clubs, Geoffrey Ashe reveals their origins in the work of Fran&#231;ois Rabelais and the activities of John Dee. He shows how the Hell-Fire Clubs&rsquo; anything-goes philosophy of &ldquo;Do what you will&rdquo;--also Aleister Crowley&rsquo;s famous motto--and community template were drawn directly from Rabelais. The author looks at the very first Hell-Fire Club, founded by Philip, Duke of Wharton, in 1720 and then at the Society of the Dilettanti, a fraternity formed in 1732. Ashe examines the life, travels, and influences of Sir Francis Dashwood, founding member of the Society of the Dilettanti and the scandalous Permissive Society at Medmenham, also known as the Monks of Medmenham. He also explores other Hell-Fire clubs the movement inspired throughout England, Scotland, and Ireland, including the violence-prone Mohocks and the Appalling Club. He shows how many illustrious figures of the day were members of these societies, such as Lord Byron. He also examines the rumors that Benjamin Franklin was a member, an allegation that can be neither confirmed nor denied. <BR><BR>Exploring the political and magical ideas that fueled this movement, the author shows how the cross-fertilization of liberty and libertinage within the Hell-Fire Clubs went on to influence both the U.S. and French revolutions, as well as the hippie movement of the 1960s, the Church of Satan founded by Anton LaVey, and the motorcycle club known as the Hells Angels. The legacy of the Hell-Fire Clubs continues to impact society, beckoning both elite and outsider to cast aside social norms and &ldquo;do what you will.&rdquo;]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<B>Chapter 6. Bubb and Fred <BR><BR><I>Sir Francis Dashwood</I></B> <BR><BR>The Dashwoods were connected by marriage with the descendants of Milton. However, there was nothing Roundhead about them. They were old-fashioned Tories, and such rebelliousness as they showed took the shape of mild Jacobite leanings. At sixteen (he was born in 1708) Francis succeeded his father&rsquo;s baronetcy and estate at West Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, with a great deal of money. He appeared on the London scene too late for the original Hell-Fire Club, but the general rakish milieu suited him well. In 1726 he made the Grand Tour with a tutor. The outcome was a legend to rival Wharton&rsquo;s, which, in this case, the hero lived to enjoy and exploit. <BR><BR>His tutor--at least according to the received story--was a Catholic Jacobite, chosen by senior relations from political motives. Francis himself was ready and eager to sample anything, including Catholicism and Jacobitism. In later life he used to say &ldquo;Taste the sweets of all things.&rdquo; But his notion of sampling was to fling himself into a role, to strike an attitude rather than to explore an idea. The pair of them moved across Europe in an atmosphere of charades, crises, demonstrations, and fornications. <BR><BR>The tour ran to a second installment during 1729-31. In Rome Francis&rsquo;s companion exposed him to the holiest shrines in the hope of converting him. His usual reaction was to laugh. On Good Friday he did more than laugh. It was customary on that day for penitents to go into the Sistine Chapel. An attendant handed each a miniature scourge, a priest put out the candles, and the congregation bared their shoulders and symbolically beat themselves, chanting prayers and lamentations. Francis, more impressed by the chapel than by its occupants, decided to test them with a proper penance. Returning muffled in a long cloak, he waited till the chapel was dark again and the holy exercises were in full swing, then produced a real horsewhip and strode up and down given the penitents a real flogging. Amid yells of &ldquo;Il diavolo! il diavolo!&rdquo; they jumped up and fled to the door. It was some time before they were all convinced that the Devil had not appeared in person. <BR><BR>On the face of it this was hardly more than a lark. It has a sequel, however, that makes Dashwood himself the butt, and raises queries about him. One night the tutor was woken up by cries of alarm, and found his young baronet staring in terror at four green eyes gleaming in an eerie uproar. They belonged to a couple of squalling cats; Francis insisted that a four-eyed devil was after him. The tutor knew better but foolishly did not say so, and for a while Francis was a Catholic convert. Disillusionment, when the tutor betrayed the secret to a friend and it came back to him, revived his old scorn so violently that he never recovered from it. <BR><BR>After his tours abroad, Sir Francis wavered homewards displaying a mixed bag of characteristics. He had the sexuality of the rake carried even further than it usually was: in the words of Walpole&rsquo;s son Horace, &ldquo;the staying power of a stallion and the impetuosity of a bull.&rdquo; He had an erratic restlessness and, in particular, a fixed contempt for most religion--not in the spirit of sceptics like Voltaire, but with a continued adolescent fondness for mockery and blasphemy, which helped to nourish a continued flirtation with the black arts. Also he had fair artistic taste, with an Italian bias, and a penchant for (so to speak) being art as well as looking at it, which took the form of dressing-up, role-playing, forming live tableaux, and being painted. <BR><BR>With all his quirks Dashwood exuded a warmth and a good-fellowship that were not bogus. When he grew to be better known and entered politics, hostile critics like Horace Walpole accused him of &ldquo;cultivating a roughness of speech&rdquo; and generally setting up as a plain blunt man, in the style of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Mark Antony. But this was not as much of a pose as they imputed. He was eventually to become Chancellor of the Exchequer. <BR><BR>During the 1730s Sir Francis was digging himself in at West Wycombe and exploring London. His town house was 18 Hanover Square. He bought erotic and magical books from Edmund Curll. He may have joined the Hell-Fire Club at the George and Vulture. He did join the Sublime Society of Beefsteaks when it was started, or rather reconstituted, in 1735. But he had already taken a more important step. Noting how an emancipated mode of life, a philistine baiting love of art and a spirit of political disaffiliation were all tending to flow together and appear in the same people, he took the lead in forming a new fraternity (members were forbidden to call it a club) where such people could combine. <BR><BR>This was the Society of Dilettanti. It was launched in 1732 with about forty members. Most were young. Some, a little older, were perhaps veterans of the Hell-Fire Club of Wharton. They met on the first Sunday of the month at the Bedford Head Tavern in Covent Garden--and later at another tavern, in Palace Yard--with unfettered conviviality and a part-comic, part-magic ritual probably devised by Sir Francis himself. The books were kept in a casket called &ldquo;Bacchus&rsquo; tomb,&rdquo; and an officer known as the Very High Steward carried a silver image of the god round his neck. The President wore a scarlet toga and sat in a curule chair. The Archmaster of Ceremonies had a &ldquo;long crimson taffeta robe full pleated with a rich Hungarian cap and a long Spanish Toledo.&rdquo; At initiations an &ldquo;Imp&rdquo; played an important part. He too wore a red robe, and he&#183;carried two lighted tapers and had a tail stuck on behind. The Secretary was always dressed as Machiavelli. The seal of the Society was a staff with coiled serpents.]]></d104>

As hunters, they would have been constantly scanning their environment, looking for food or threats (distractibility); they&rsquo;d have to act without hesitation (impulsivity); and they&rsquo;d have to love the high-stimulation and risk-filled environment of the hunting field. With our structured public schools, office workplaces, and factories those who inherit a surplus of &ldquo;hunter skills&rdquo; are often left frustrated in a world that doesn&rsquo;t understand or support them. <BR><BR>As Hartmann shows, by reframing our view of ADHD, we can begin to see it not as a disorder, but as simply a difference and, in some ways, an advantage. He reveals how some of the world&rsquo;s most successful people can be labeled as ADHD hunters and offers concrete non-drug methods and practices to help hunters--and their parents, teachers, and managers--embrace their differences, nurture creativity, and find success in school, at work, and at home. Providing a supportive &ldquo;survival&rdquo; guide to help fine tune your natural skill set, rather than suppress it, Hartmann shows that each mind--whether hunter, farmer, or somewhere in between--has value and great potential waiting to be tapped.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<B>Chapter 3. Hunters in Our Schools and Offices</B> <BR><BR>Prior to the early 1970s, when ADHD was first characterized as a specific disorder, ADHD children and adults were largely treated simply as &ldquo;bad people&rdquo;. They were the kids who always got into trouble, the James Deans of the world, the rootless and unsettled adults like Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s father, The Lone Ranger, or John Dillinger. <BR><BR>More recent research, however, has demonstrated a high incidence of ADHD among the parents of ADHD children. This discovery caused some psychologists to initially postulate that ADHD was the result of growing up in a dysfunctional family; they suggested that ADHD may follow the same pattern as child or spousal abuse. The dietary-cause advocates contended that children pattern their parent&rsquo;s eating habits, and this accounts for the generational patterns of ADHD. Other studies suggest that, like Down&rsquo;s Syndrome or muscular dystrophy, ADHD is a genetic disease, with the A1 variant of the D2 dopamine receptor gene identified by scientists as the leading candidate. <BR><BR>But if ADHD is a genetic disease or an abnormality, it&rsquo;s a popular one, possibly afflicting as many as 25 million individuals in the United States. With such a wide distribution among our population, is it reasonable to assume that ADHD is simply a quirk? That it&rsquo;s some sort of an aberration caused by defective genes or child abuse? Where did ADHD come from? The answer is: people with ADHD are the leftover hunters, those whose ancestors evolved and matured thousands of years in the past in hunting societies. <BR><BR>As the human race moved from its earliest ancestors, two basic types of cultures evolved. In the areas that were lush with plant and animal life and had a low human population density, hunters and gatherers predominated. In other parts of the world (particularly Asia), farming or agricultural societies evolved. <BR><BR><B><I>Successful Hunters</I></B> <BR><BR>Be it pursuing buffalo in North America, hunting deer in Europe, chasing wildebeest in Africa, or picking fish from a stream in Asia, these hunters needed a certain set of physical and mental characteristics to be successful:<BR><BR><B> &bull; They constantly monitor their environment.</B> Failure to be fully aware of the environment and notice the faint sound might mean a swift and painful death or the difference between a full belly and hunger. <BR><BR><B>&bull; They can totally throw themselves into the hunt; time is elastic.</B> Another characteristic of a good Hunter is the ability to totally focus on the moment, abandoning all consideration of any other time or place. When the Hunter sees the prey he gives chase simply living totally in that one pure moment. When involved in the hunt, time seems to speed; when not in the hunt, time becomes slow. While a Hunter&rsquo;s ability to concentrate in general may be low, his ability to utterly throw himself into the hunt at the moment is astonishing. <BR><BR><B>&bull; They&rsquo;re flexible, capable of changing strategy on a moment&rsquo;s notice.</B> If the wild boar vanishes into the brush, and a rabbit appears, the Hunter is off in a new direction. Orderliness is not particularly important to a Hunter, but the abilities to make a quick decision and then act on it are vital. <BR><BR><B>&bull; They can throw an incredible burst of energy into the hunt,</B> so much so that they often injure themselves or exceed &ldquo;normal&rdquo; capabilities, without realizing it until later. Not unlike that quintessential of all Hunters, the lion, they have incredible bursts of energy--but not necessarily a lot of staying power. <BR><BR><B>&bull; They think visually.</B> Hunters often describe their actions in terms of pictures, rather than words or feelings. They create outlines in their heads of where they&rsquo;ve been and where they&rsquo;re going. Hunters often aren&rsquo;t much interested in abstractions. <BR><BR><B>&bull; They love the hunt, but are easily bored by mundane tasks,</B> such as having to clean the fish, dress the meat, or fill out the paperwork. Kemmons Wilson, the founder of Holiday Inns, had a group of executives he called Bear Skinners who would take care of the details of &ldquo;skinning and cleaning&rdquo; after Wilson had &ldquo;shot the bear&rdquo; (negotiated a new hotel site, brought in new financing, opened a new division, etc.). <BR><BR><B>&bull; They&rsquo;ll face danger that &ldquo;normal&rdquo; individuals would avoid.</B> A wounded boar, or elephant, or bear, can kill you--and many a Hunter has been killed by his would-be prey. If you extend this analogy to warfare, where the Hunters are often the front line infantry or the most aggressive officers, the same is true. Hunters take risks. <BR><BR><B>&bull; They&rsquo;re hard on themselves and those around them.</B> When your life depends on split-second decisions, your frustration and impatience threshold necessarily tend to be low. A fellow Hunter who doesn&rsquo;t get out of the way of a shot, or a soldier who defies orders and smokes on a dark night showing the enemy your position, cannot be tolerated.<BR><BR><B><I>People with ADHD Are Descendants of Hunters</I></B> <BR><BR>If you compare the list of classic ADHD symptoms, and the list of the characteristics of a good hunter, you&rsquo;ll see that they match almost perfectly. In other words, an individual with the ADHD collection of characteristics would make an extraordinarily good hunter. A failure to have any one of those characteristics might mean death in the forest or jungle. <BR><BR>It is my hope that this book will help us remove the stigma of &ldquo;illness&rdquo; or &ldquo;deficit&rdquo; associated with a diagnosis of ADHD and related conditions. A second, and equally important, goal is to provide specific tools to &ldquo;work around&rdquo; the dilemma of being an ADHD &ldquo;Hunter&rdquo; in a contemporary society that is largely structured for and by non-ADHD &ldquo;Farmers,&rdquo; a concept we will explore in detail. The individuals with whom I&rsquo;ve shared this theory have found it both positive and transformational. This is the spirit in which this book is offered, with the sincere hope that it may help more teachers, psychologists, psychiatrists, and parents to empower and enable rather than label as sick or disabled ADD children and adults.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[&ldquo;In this groundbreaking book, Thom Hartmann makes a unique contribution to our understanding of ADHD. In considering ADHD in an evolutionary context, Thom was the first to point out the survival advantages of ADHD in hunter-gatherer societies and also the first to identify the link between ADHD and creativity. As such, Thom will be recognized as a pioneer contributing to the reconceptualization of ADHD from being considered only a &lsquo;disorder&rsquo; to being viewed as a &lsquo;mode of thought&rsquo; characterized by enhanced flexibility and creativity.&rdquo;]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[A confidence-boosting program based on the spiritual insights of Sanskrit, the language of enlightenment <BR><BR>&bull; Draws on traditional stories from East and West and scholarly works to reveal the wisdom behind Sanskrit words and how to experience them to transform our lives and build confidence, certainty, clarity, and success <BR><BR>&bull; Explains the fourfold energy of the Conscious Confidence program: Focusing, Uniting, Simplifying, and Energizing <BR><BR>&bull; Offers practical exercises for discovering our inner certainty and overcoming fear, anxiety, and insecurity <BR><BR>Called &ldquo;the language of enlightenment,&rdquo; Sanskrit is truly unique among all the languages of the world. This ancient language, upon which so many of our English words are based, gives us an entire system to show what to do in order to experience the full meaning of a word. In this profound way, Sanskrit offers a touchstone of timeless wisdom that each of us can access to transform our lives and build confidence, certainty, clarity, and success. <BR><BR>In <I>Conscious Confidence</I>, Sanskrit scholar Sarah Mane offers a practical confidence-boosting program, derived from the deepest meanings of Sanskrit concepts, to help you establish a safe and secure reference point from which to see the world and make clear decisions on how to act, what to say, and how to feel. She explores the Sanskrit roots of English words related to confidence and success, unlocking rich, three-dimensional understandings of each word as well as guidance on how to obtain confidence and find your path in life. For example, the word <I>attitude</I>, based on its Sanskrit roots, means &ldquo;<I>our point of view, our intent, and our conduct</I>.&rdquo; A positive attitude means we have a self-aware point of view, have an intent for the good, and conduct ourselves in ways that reflect both. This true <I>attitude</I> gives us a positive and powerful place from which to view the world. The author also incorporates traditional stories from East and West, such as the <I>Mahabharata</I> and the works of Plato, scholarly references, and accounts of people discovering hidden depths in their own lives through the ancient truth of Sanskrit. <BR><BR>Drawing upon the deeper meanings behind several Sanskrit words for confidence, Mane outlines principles for harnessing the fourfold energies of Conscious Confidence and offers practical exercises for discovering our inner certainty. She explains how the Conscious Confidence method allows us to tackle the growing anxiety and fear that hang like a shadow over many of us and look to the unchanging core of selfhood for certainty, rather than ever-changing externals. <BR><BR>With the Conscious Confidence program and the wisdom of Sanskrit, you can discover a strong and steady inner source of compassion, self-direction, self-empowerment, and the life force of self-confidence.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<B>From the Introduction</B> <BR><BR>The ancient language of Sanskrit, used by the sages of India to write their poetry, epics, and works of profound wisdom, is an incomparable tool for delving into the truest knowledge. Sanskrit is not just a language to be written and spoken but is also a doorway to gaining understanding of our experience of life and truth. <BR><BR>The aim of this book is to welcome you to the world of Conscious Confidence, a practical way to use the wisdom of Sanskrit to find clarity and success. By reading this book, you are connecting to a thread of timeless wisdom that has guided humanity throughout the millennia. Opinions, viewpoints, and attitudes come and go, but this golden cord of conscious wisdom is ever-fresh, relevant and powerful. It is wisdom upon which we can utterly depend. <BR><BR>Conscious Confidence is like a great tree with deep strong roots, able to withstand storms and tempests and also provide shelter, stability and nourishment. It is grounded yet continually growing, expanding, and evolving. Sanskrit and timeless wisdom help us to plant that tree and deepen those roots. Conscious Confidence is the confidence you have when you live boldly and courageously from a commitment to giving the best of your own unique self-expression. It is the confidence you experience when you are awake and aware of your own potential and strength. <BR><BR>Our life is an expression of what we hold in our heart--of our understanding of things and their meaning. This book is designed for you to consciously redefine those meanings and discover new dimensions of understanding and awareness from the depths of Sanskrit wisdom. This will awaken you to your potential, your core values, and what&rsquo;s really important in life. With the ancient wisdom of Sanskrit, you can learn how to transform pain and suffering to joy, freedom, and fulfilment. <BR><BR><B>From Chapter Two: Balancing the Body, Mind, and Heart <BR><BR></B><I><B>What does Sanskrit teach us about balance? <BR></B></I><BR>The Sanskrit word for balance is <I>santulana</I>, meaning to weigh one thing against another or to balance together. <BR><BR>The root for this Sanskrit word meaning &ldquo;balance&rdquo; is <I>tul</I>. This root means &ldquo;weighing and determining the weight of something by lifting it up.&rdquo; <BR><BR>P&#257;&#7751;ini&rsquo;s statement for this root <I>tul</I> is: &ldquo;That measuring is to be found in the act of measuring.&rdquo; <BR><BR>This seems rather circular and obvious, so how does this help our understanding? <BR><BR>The key point of this word &ldquo;balance&rdquo; is measuring. Measuring means knowing when to stop one activity before embarking on the next. <BR><BR>An analogy may help, so imagine a set of scales.<BR><BR>If we intend to measure out a quantity of sand, and we want to keep the scales balanced, then we need to measure out the same quantity on each side. First, we pour an amount of sand into one side.<BR><BR>The scales will be unbalanced at this point because there&rsquo;s nothing on the other side to counter-balance yet. <BR><BR>Then we start carefully pouring sand into the other side. Slowly both sides of the scales move closer to being level and balanced. <BR><BR>Now we reach the crucial moment, where we determine that both sides of the scales are balanced, and we stop pouring. If we continue to pour more sand, we will create another imbalance on the other side. <BR><BR>Achieving balance hinges on stopping at the right moment. <BR><BR>Thus, the essence of balance and measure is knowing when to stop. This can be obvious such as when we work too long and too hard and it is time to go home. On another level, it can be time to stop thinking and to take action, or it can be time to get our feelings under control and begin to reflect on the lesson we can learn from a challenging experience. Too much thought and not enough emotion causes an imbalance and we can be cold and disconnected. If we are overly emotional, we can be irrational and unsteady. When we are not aligned, our actions and choices do not balance our head and our heart, and the body usually bears the brunt through stress, tension, and a lack of wellbeing. <BR><BR><B>Sample Exercise<BR><BR>Practices for Core Values <BR><BR><I>Starter Practice: Exploring Values</I></B> <BR><BR>In this starter practice, we&rsquo;re going to use a volunteer organization to trigger our self-reflection on our own Core Values. <BR><BR>Think of one volunteer organization that you&rsquo;ve heard about and appeals to you. Consider the values of that organization. Orange Sky for example is based on respect and dignity. Other organizations may value service, care, or compassion. If the organization that you select doesn&rsquo;t have any stated values, then reflect on what you feel to be the values that underpin their mission, and what they do.<BR><BR>Write down three to five values of this organization. For example, in the case of Orange Sky the list might expand to include: respect, dignity, compassion, care, and service. <BR><BR>Research the meanings of each of the listed values of your selected organization, so you broaden and deepen your understanding of those values. There is always more to learn. This exercise helps us to transcend any assumptions. You might look up each word on quotation websites to find out how, for example, Shakespeare, Oprah Winfrey, or Martin Luther King used the word. Make some notes in your journal of your research. <BR><BR>Now take some time to consider your notes and think about these values. Ask yourself the following questions: <BR><BR>What is it about these values that draws me to them? What is about these values that makes them significant to me? <BR><BR>What other examples can I recall of these values in action? You might remember something you did, or some action of a family member, co-worker, neighbor or someone in your community. <BR><BR>The most important part of this exercise is to expand your understanding. This is achieved by delving deeper into the meaning of the values and asking questions. Answers may or may not come. The questions are what count.]]></d104>

That someone is Sarah Mane. Sarah provides a proposition for us to move beyond the limitations of past conditioning and outdated beliefs and realize the truth that we are magnificent universal beings. This is the timeless wisdom of Sanskrit in its very fluency and perfection in the very essence of igniting genius possibilities.

Mane takes these lessons and weaves them into larger life goals and a confidence-boosting program designed to apply to all walks of people in different stages of their spiritual or life journeys.

      <d104><![CDATA[&ldquo;This book is no quick snack. It's an epic feast for a hungry soul who wants access to some of the deepest wisdom that has come to us over thousands of years. Sarah Mane has been immersed in a journey of discovery through philosophy and the study of Sanskrit since she was just a pup. In what could be a formidable, dry, boring meal straight out of academia, she serves instead a rich, nourishing spread of knowledge and insights that satiates and satisfy mind, body and soul. I thoroughly admire her tremendous skills of communication, curiosity, and her deep comprehension of her materials. As a book designer, I quite literally read hundreds of books, so I am really pleased to celebrate one of the few books that has hooked my avid attention. I plan to have her book by my side forever, so I can linger with, dip into and savor each rich, surprising, succulent chapter.&rdquo;]]></d104>

In charge of such birth is the Great Mother, the eternal source of all creation. She is calling on the feminine within us all to create a world worthy of the next seven generations and begin an era of peace, abundance, and spiritual evolution. To birth this new world, we must release our hold on old destructive patterns and instead embrace the divine feminine qualities of intuition, powerful creativity, and rhythmic renewal. <BR><BR>As Christine Page reveals, the Great Mother hears our heart&rsquo;s yearning to escape our old ways of suffering and struggle to find peace, fulfillment, and joy. She is reaching out to us across the dimensions, offering spiritual initiation and the chance to know ourselves fully right now. Dr. Page explains how important it is to acknowledge and integrate our shadow selves--the unloved parts of us--so we can radiate our light from the fullness of who we are without shame or judgment. Drawing on alchemy and mythology, the author details the journey of the soul through the twelve signs of the zodiac until our inner light shines. She also explores how to connect with and use sacred spiritual tools to open our hearts and merge with the Great Mother&rsquo;s love and creative powers. <BR><BR>Exploring the mythology of the Triple Goddess, the author explains how the three faces of the Great Mother help us on our spiritual journey of transformation: As virgin she inspires us to manifest our dreams. As mother, she teaches us to celebrate and nurture all living things, especially ourselves. As crone, she shows us that creativity changes like the seasons, encouraging us not to be possessed by our creations but to embrace mystery and impermanence. Finally, the Great Mother emboldens us to build our magician&rsquo;s wand, the rod of light along the spine which enables us to be masters of our creativity, bringing forth transformation for ourselves and generations of children still to come as we embark into a new era of expanded consciousness and love.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<B>Chapter 1. The Creation Myth</B><BR><BR>It feels natural to begin our journey in the &ldquo;place&rdquo; from which everything is born and will eventually return. In our modern world, this is described as Light, God, the Source, or the Great Mother--an all-inclusive energy without differentiation. More scientific terms include the holographic universe, phase space or the void, implying the energetic synthesis of all which has been, and will ever be. <BR><BR>For the ancient people, including the Egyptians, Sumerians, and Babylonians, the origin of life was called the primordial waters of no-thingness, possessing strong feminine characteristics such as darkness, chaos, and fiery creative power. In other words, in the beginning was powerful feminine potentiality, similar to the matrix, awaiting fertilization into form. <BR><BR><B>The Triple Goddess</B><BR><BR>As we continue to explore the ancient Creation Myths, we learn that the primordial waters of the Great Mother give birth to herself, creating the Triple Goddess, consisting of the three archetypal faces of the feminine. Each face is essential for the complete creative process and together they express the divine power of the Great Mother. The Virgin represents creative inspiration, the Mother creative nurturing, and the Crone creative transformation. All three of them act exclusively through their unique style of compassion and intuition, ever expanding our awareness of ourselves toward our perfect eternal state.<BR><BR>Traditional wisdom tells us the Triple Goddess was honored as far back as 25,000 BCE. But in the past 3500 years, under patriarchal rule, the Goddess and everything associated with the feminine (intuition, emotions, and rhythmic cycles) have been suppressed or denigrated. Yet without the embodiment of these gifts of the Triple Goddess, whatever our gender, we will be unable to fulfil our soul&rsquo;s destiny.<BR><BR><B>Intuition</B> maintains the connection to our soul&rsquo;s blueprint. <BR><BR><B>Emotions</B> act as the force behind all creativity and transformation. <BR><BR><B>Cycles</B> ensure evolution through transformation which occurs through inspired growth, embodiment of wisdom and the release of old patterns or things which no longer serve us. <BR><BR>Let&rsquo;s consider each aspect of the Triple Goddess in turn. <BR><BR><B>THE VIRGIN</B><BR><BR>Contrary to popular belief the word Virgin does not reflect a sexually inexperienced girl but instead means &ldquo;to be complete unto oneself without the need for another to make one whole.&rdquo; Often depicted wearing white, the Virgin radiates a state of energetic perfection where she is comfortable with herself and has nothing to hide. An analogy would be that when we buy a jigsaw puzzle, the picture on the front of the box reveals the ultimate expression of wholeness, and yet it is only through working patiently with each piece that the picture is recreated from the building blocks within. <BR><BR>The Virgin can be described as:<BR><BR>&bull; Our spiritual blueprint awaiting manifestation<BR><BR>&bull; Our unrealized or un-manifested self &bull; Our imagination containing all the seeds of possibility<BR><BR>&bull; Energetic perfection <BR><BR>&bull; Our holographic self in which everything is essentially present As we deepen our study of the Virgin within mythology and her relationship to wholeness and purity, it&rsquo;s easy to recognize her within the Christian world as the Virgin Mary. Unfortunately, her radiant pure light of authenticity has often been misinterpreted as possessing purity of thoughts, words and deeds, especially of a sexual nature. These twisted dogmas were set in place thousands of years ago by a patriarchy who wanted to control women and who determined that, by creating an nattainable role model, women would always feel ashamed of their femininity.<BR><BR>But if we return to the original meaning, imagine being in a relationship where you knew you were &ldquo;complete unto yourself, without the need for another to make you whole.&rdquo; We would still enjoy the creative charge which comes from intimacy but without the fear of rejection, the stickiness of co-dependency or the burden of unrealistic expectations commonly placed on another person to make us whole. Imagine the joy of just being in the presence of another soul who knows and trusts his or her implicit wholeness and allows you to do the same. <BR><BR>On an esoteric level, the Virgin&rsquo;s surety of who she is equates to the fact that, dwelling as she does within the unified field where there is no separation, she has no concept of another but only an appreciation of us. <BR><BR><B>THE CRONE <BR></B><BR>There is no doubt that, of all the aspects of the Triple Goddess, the Crone is probably the most difficult for an individual to accept and integrate, being both revered and feared within most cultures. Known as the Old Woman, the Wise One, the Dark Mother, and the Hag, she is commonly portrayed as being bloodthirsty, sexually promiscuous, and extremely ugly. The territory she rules is seen as chaotic, representing the unknown and untamed aspects of our nature, which is why, those who like to stay in control, find her appearance in their lives so disturbing.<BR><BR>Representations of this powerful feminine archetype include Kali the destroyer, Cerridwen the corpse-eating sow, Sekhmet the fire-breathing lion, Isis the vulture queen, Morgan Le Fay the death queen, and Persephone the destroyer; no wonder she has acquired such a reputation! All represent death, winter, destruction, and doom. Indeed, the Grim Reaper, seen brandishing his scythe as a sign of impending death, originates from an ancient Scythian goddess whose symbol, like that of many of the death goddesses, is the dying crescent moon. <BR><BR>As we will discover, each cultural myth surrounding the Crone offers a different perspective of her archetypal energy, although all agree, this is one powerful lady!]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA["These two books both contain an incredibly powerful message for our time. The message of the Fierce Feminine, the Dark Mother, a collective upwelling of universal outrage and sacred rage at the way we are treating the planet and each other. You will probably have seen the various videos featuring a message from the virus telling us to consider the essentials and expressing the Earth&rsquo;s relief at a slowing down of our frenetic activity. Christine expresses this [in The Heart of the Great Mother] as the Dark Goddess calling 'time' for all of us now: &lsquo;she is not interested in our bargaining tactics, excuses, or entreaties, especially those linked to our small ego&rsquo;s desire not to upset the status quo. It is time to move on&hellip;whether we are ready to or not.&rsquo;"]]></d104>

Those with ADHD grow up wounded, told by teachers, guidance counselors, even parents that they are dysfunctional and unable to succeed in the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; world. But, as ADHD expert Thom Hartmann explains, those with ADHD are capable of great success if they can shift the negative self-image created by others and learn to work with their unique strengths. <BR><BR>In this accessible guide for adults with ADHD and the parents and teachers of ADHD children, Hartmann offers a practical system of useful tools and strategies to heal the damage done to a person who grew up labeled as &ldquo;dysfunctional&rdquo; and help them cope with--and succeed at--daily life. He explains how the character traits of ADHD were once valuable assets in hunter-gatherer societies and that the later dominance of agricultural and industrial societies, where &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; and &ldquo;worker&rdquo; skillsets excel, left ADHD &ldquo;hunters&rdquo; as behavioral outcasts. Sharing simple and often fast-acting techniques from neurolinguistic programming (NLP), Hartmann explains how those with ADHD can take back their personal power, recalibrate painful memories into valuable learning experiences, shed fears and negative habits, and rebuild their self-image in a positive way. <BR><BR>By integrating the strategies in this book into daily life, those with ADHD can transform their way of responding to the world, discover personal motivation, and teach their children to do the same. As Hartmann reveals, it is not ADHD that needs to be healed but our attitudes toward those born with the &ldquo;hunter&rdquo; gift.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<B>From Chapter 3. Life Is What We Think It Is</B> <BR><BR>When we understand how much influence our beliefs and assumptions have on how we perceive and experience the world, we can then begin the process of changing those beliefs and assumptions which are not useful to us. <BR><BR>A good starting point for this redefinition process is the notion of self-identity--where a person fits into the overall larger scheme of social and cultural life. <BR><BR>For example, consider what would happen if you were to dump the label of <I>diseased, disordered</I>, or <I>defective</I>. How would your life be different if, instead, you started looking at your or your child&rsquo;s ADHD as &ldquo;Hunter qualities,&rdquo; and searched out those particular &ldquo;Hunter skills&rdquo; which are the most useful? Using this model of reality, you would now have the power to identify the behaviors and strategies you have which you&rsquo;d like to keep, those you&rsquo;d like to get control of, and those you&rsquo;d like to get rid of. <BR><BR><I><B>Identifying and Changing Limiting Beliefs <BR></B><BR>Limiting beliefs</I> are those stories we tell ourselves which cause us to sabotage our own best efforts. They hurt and cripple our lives, diminish our abilities, or hold us back from reaching our goals. Everyone has limiting beliefs. Everyone can change them. Most people don&rsquo;t realize it&rsquo;s possible to change them, and, for that matter, don&rsquo;t even realize that they ever made a decision in their lives about what to believe and what not to believe.<BR><BR><I><B>Modeling Other People&rsquo;s Beliefs <BR></B></I><BR>One very effective way to change limiting beliefs is to find another person who has the same &ldquo;problem&rdquo; but who apparently doesn&rsquo;t share that limiting belief--a person who has figured out some other, more useful belief and is living it in their life. Particularly useful in the context of ADHD are historical figures who sure look like they must have had ADHD--like Winston Churchill, John Kennedy, or Ben Franklin--and read their biographies to learn how they overcame their ADHD symptoms (Franklin&rsquo;s autobiography is particularly useful for this). Visualize that person living their life with their empowering belief, what would be for you the new belief. Then visualize yourself in that same situation. Check out how you feel about it. If it feels ok, then step into yourself in that visualization and experience the reality of the new belief. Ask yourself what it will sound and smell and feel like as a way of moving right into the experience. <BR><BR><B><I>Presupposing Change in Beliefs and Behaviors</I></B><BR><BR>One of the most effective ways to facilitate and ensure change is to convince people that the change is inevitable. Doing this on a conscious level, however, is often somewhere between difficult and impossible. It&rsquo;s much easier to speak to the unconscious.<BR><BR>For example, a child was brought to see me who, at the age of 8, was still dragging around his childhood blanket and sucking his thumb. He&rsquo;d been hassled considerably about it, mostly by his older sister and his well-intentioned grandparents, who lived nearby. As a result, he&rsquo;d developed a lot of anxiety around the issue, and, it came out, actually believed that he may be dragging the blanket around for the rest of his life. That thought, as much as any other, haunted him. <BR><BR>So instead of challenging his reality at a conscious level, I posed a question which <I>presupposed</I> the change as already being in the process of happening. In the course of a friendly conversation about people we&rsquo;ve all known who&rsquo;ve had childhood habits which eventually went away, I said, &ldquo;I wonder how many weeks it&rsquo;ll be before you feel good knowing that your blanket is back in your bedroom while you&rsquo;re somewhere else?&rdquo; <BR><BR>He nodded, as if he was slightly confused but wanted to agree, and then I changed the subject back to talking about his friends and other things. But that one sentence was what the entire session was all about: it delivered to his <I>unconscious</I> mind several direct statements of &ldquo;already a done-deal fact&rdquo;: 1) That a time would come when he&rsquo;d no longer need to drag around his blanket; 2) that it would actually feel good; and 3) that it would happen within a period of weeks. Within three or four minutes of my having made that statement, I (and his mother, who was sitting in on the session) noticed a rather dramatic change in his body posture and tone of voice when he discussed his blanket. Previous to the statement, he&rsquo;d pull his knees up to his chin and hold the blanket to him; after it, he simply sat with it on the chair beside him in his right hand. The change had already begun to work. <BR><BR>Such interventions are classic examples of the work of Erickson, Bandler, and Grinder, among others. The, &ldquo;I wonder when . . .&rdquo; statement is a powerful way to influence people, particularly children, without directly challenging their limiting beliefs. It goes around the beliefs, to the back-door of the mind as it were, and delivers to the unconscious mind an opportunity to experience a the possibility of a new reality.<BR><BR>In another similar case, a child who&rsquo;d been diagnosed with ADHD largely because of his dislike of homework heard, &ldquo;I wonder how long it&rsquo;ll be before you discover the secret of making homework fun that so many of the A-grade students know?&rdquo; Notice the presuppositions in there: the child then began a hunt to &ldquo;discover the secret,&rdquo; and eventually found it! <BR><BR>Whether you&rsquo;re dealing directly with an ADHD behavior (which is a very loose and slippery definition) or a specific behavior which may arise from, have to do with, or impinge on the life of a child with ADHD, this technique can be very useful.<BR><BR>I wonder how many hours it&rsquo;ll be before you try it out with your child in a way that&rsquo;s helpful, supportive, and healing?]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[A guide to discovering the spiritual agreements between our souls and those of our animal companions <BR><BR>&bull; Explains how animals have physical or behavioral issues to evolve their souls as well as help our soul&rsquo;s evolution and release past-life karma <BR><BR>&bull; Describes what happens energetically and spiritually with animals in the weeks before they transition and during their passing <BR><BR>&bull; Includes practical instructions for identifying the different types of animal soul contracts and aligning with them to assist your shared evolutionary journey <BR><BR>Animal lovers are extraordinary. Despite awareness that we will probably outlive our beloved pets, we are still drawn, time and time again, to the connection, joy, and unconditional love that come with sharing our lives, homes, and laps with animals. Many of us feel something deeper than just companionship with our animal friends--a heart-to-heart connection felt all the way to the soul level. <BR><BR>Revealing the higher purpose and soul mission behind our relationships with our animal companions, Tammy Billups explores the spiritual contracts that are created when a human bonds with an animal and shows how we come into each other&rsquo;s lives for a reason. Providing real-life examples, Billups explains why animals choose, at the soul level, to have certain perceived negative experiences, such as physical or behavioral issues, to evolve their souls, clear karma, and help our soul&rsquo;s evolution. She shows that human and animal souls orchestrate every experience and interaction that holds potential for transformation and healing, including the final transition. She demonstrates the inner dynamics of the animal-human relationship to help animal lovers understand their soul contracts with their pets. The inspirational, real-life examples of animal-human tandem healings that Billups facilitated identify the soul contracts within each pairing that transformed feelings of grief, loss, abandonment, betrayal, trauma, abuse, and anxiety. <BR><BR>The author reveals how animals we have previously loved and shared our lives with come back, either on the spirit level or reincarnated in a new animal form, to support us. Offering peace and hope to those who&rsquo;ve lost beloved animal companions, she describes what she&rsquo;s witnessed during healing sessions with animals in the weeks before they transition and during their passing. Billups also includes practical instructions for identifying different types of animal soul contracts and connecting with and enlisting the help of your light team or spirit guides. <BR><BR>By discovering the soul agreements that underlie our animal partnerships, we can find meaning in the issues that arise with our animals and ourselves, support our souls&rsquo; mutual evolution, and allow the soul contracts to weave their spiritual magic in the animal-human relationship.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[4 <BR><BR>Types of Soul Contracts Defined <BR><BR><B>A HIGHER PERSPECTIVE</B> <BR><BR>Since my awakening and embracing my new life path, I have been intrigued and fascinated by the higher purpose of our soul&rsquo;s evolutionary journey. I feel compelled and driven to reach for the higher perspective within the day-to-day experiences, especially those that elicit fear-based reactions such as anger, shame, frustration, judgment, jealousy, or insecurity. When we realize that every experience in our lives is always unfolding for our highest good, we feel less stressed about the future. <BR><BR>Seeking the gifts and higher perspective within each experience has the ability to soothe and console us in the midst of difficult times. When you take a step back and observe a situation from a detached viewpoint, it diffuses the fear-based thoughts and sheds light on the part within you that is being triggered. Then you are more apt to react from a grounded and more aware place versus through the lens of unhealed emotional wounds. Triggers are simply indications that it&rsquo;s a perfect time to pause, reflect, and look within to determine what is at the root of your reaction, which has shown up for you to see more clearly. <BR><BR>You can apply this same principle to your animal companions by reaching for the higher purpose in their actions, behaviors, and physical issues. Then you can more easily interpret your animal&rsquo;s experiences and your emotional response to them. Think of it as sprinkling a little stardust on the situation, and voila! You suddenly see a different form of communication coming from your animal that wasn&rsquo;t even on the radar to begin with. <BR><BR><I>Growth happens when you are open to changing your mind through seeking the higher perspective and then allow a transformative shift in consciousness to unfold. <BR></I><BR>Part of my mission is to provide a fresh new perspective on how people can choose to interact with their animals. When an animal lover recognizes and leans into the higher purpose of their soul agreements with their animals, and the reason they are together, the relationship takes on new meaning. <BR><BR><B>Defining a Soul Contract<BR></B><BR>A soul contract is an agreement between two beings to expand their growth in this lifetime. Before your animals incarnated to be with you, your Higher Selves agreed upon the lessons and growth needed for your mutual healing and development. For ease in understanding this material I interchangeably use the words <I>agreement</I> and <I>contract</I>. <BR><BR>Through my work over the last two decades I&rsquo;ve identified and documented seven types of soul agreements. Indeed there are seven different conceptual approaches that animals and humans use to engage in intentional soul communication for their mutual growth. Held within each level are distinctive ways that you are helping each other to live out your preplanned agreements. <BR><BR>Agreements can be with any animal that has touched you in ways small and large. This can include the animals that you live with but will also be animals that have briefly been in your life, in addition to animals in nature. <BR><BR>The types of soul contracts are diverse, and all are important to your growth and to your animal&rsquo;s growth. Since being in a body comes with challenges, the prearranged contracts can fluctuate and change as unexpected experiences potentially thwart the original soul plan. Challenges are created to learn specific lessons necessary to ignite the richness and depth of the positive emotions you and your animals desire to feel. <BR><BR>All beings have free will, and life is known to bring a few curveballs. Although it&rsquo;s rare for a soul plan to veer off course, if your experiences have caused your inner soul Siri to recalculate the route, it is possible to manifest a similar or even improved outcome for your soul progression. Your light team and animal companions are aligned in such a way to help keep you on the path you designed. This takes the form of synchronicities, gentle nudges via your thoughts, and inspirational ideas and actions. <BR><BR>There is an unlimited amount of time to evolve and learn. Every being aspires to feel more peace, joy, and unconditional love more often, and each being&rsquo;s path and timing is unique. Animals and humans will instinctively set the right and perfect tempo and timing for their Earth lessons. <BR><BR>The closer you become emotionally to your animals, the more engaged they are in your soul&rsquo;s growth. And in turn you will both agree to implement contracts for your mutual growth. If you are an introvert or empath it is more likely that your soul has turned to animals to collaborate with in order to facilitate your personal transformation. <BR><BR>As you read through the following contract types, notice which agreements you can relate to with your current or past animal companion(s). There are usually many types of agreements operating in each of your animal collaborations. Every agreement, at its core, is rooted in unconditional love for the other being and is agreed upon in advance by both beings in the relationship. When there are multiple people in the house in relationship with the animal, each pairing has their own personalized agreement. That&rsquo;s why two people will describe or see different traits in the same animal and respond differently to their behaviors. <BR><BR>The contracts are designed to assist both the animal and their human to heal and enrich their soul development on the path to feeling more love and less suffering.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[A powerful story of spiritual awakening, reconnection with Nature, and rekindling of ancestral wisdom <BR><BR>&bull; Details the author&rsquo;s encounters with ancestral spirits and animal teachers, such as Coy-Wolf, and profound moments of direct connection with the natural world <BR><BR>&bull; Shows how ancestral connections and intimate communications with Nature are not unique or restricted to those with indigenous cultural roots <BR><BR>&bull; Reveals how reconnection with ancestors and the natural world offers insight and solutions for the complex problems we face <BR><BR>We are but a few generations removed from millennia spent living in intimate contact with the natural world and in close commune with ancestral spirits. Who we are and who we think we are is rooted in historical connections with those who came before us and in our relationships with the land and the sentient natural world. When we wander too far from our roots, our ancestors and kin in the natural world call us home, sometimes with gentle whispers and sometimes in loud voices sounding alarms. <BR><BR>In this powerful story of spiritual awakening, Randy Kritkausky shares his journey into the realm of ancestral Native American connections and intimate encounters with Mother Earth and shows how anyone can spiritually reconnect with their ancestors and Nature. Like 70 percent of those who identify as Native American, Kritkausky grew up off the reservation. As he explains, for such &ldquo;off reservation&rdquo; indigenous people rediscovering ancestral practices amounts to a reawakening and offers significant insights about living in a society that is struggling to mend a heavily damaged planet. The author reveals how the awakening process was triggered by his own self-&#173;questioning and the resumption of ties with his Potawatomi ancestors. He details his encounters with ancestral spirits and animal teachers, such as Coy-Wolf. He shares moments of direct connection with the natural world, moments when the consciousness of other living beings, flora and fauna, became accessible and open to communication. <BR><BR>Through his profound storytelling, Kritkausky shows how ancestral connections and intimate communications with Nature are not unique or restricted to those with indigenous cultural roots. Offering a bridge between cultures, a path that can be followed by Native and non-Native alike, the author shows that spiritual awakening can happen anywhere, for anyone, and can open the gateway to deeper understanding.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<B>From Chapter 6: What Coy-Wolf Taught Me</B> <BR><BR>We live in a forested area of Vermont, not high in the Green Mountains but in the flatter Champlain Valley Clayplain. There is as much farmland as forest in our area. It is ideal habitat for deer and other wildlife that like living on forest-meadow boundaries where biodiversity flourishes and protective cover can be quickly found. <BR><BR>A relatively recent arrival in this habitat is the Coy-Wolf. Just a few decades ago the appearance of such mammals was discussed in terms of the rising population of &ldquo;coyotes.&rdquo; However, wildlife biologists soon began to take note of the size of these predators and observed characteristics not typical of coyotes. For example, their larger skulls and teeth more resembled those of wolves than coyotes. Then, more recently, with advances in genetic research, it became possible to unravel part of the mystery and migratory history of this new addition to New England wildlife.<BR><BR> It is now recognized that in the 19th century, white European settlers virtually exterminated wolves. With wolves gone in the northeastern United States, coyotes from the southwest slowly migrated northward into this abandoned ecological niche. In the second decade of the 20th century, a coyote and one of the remaining gray wolves in southeastern Canada interbred on or about the site of the current Algonquin Park in Ontario Province. From there, offspring of this new &ldquo;half-breed&rdquo; slowly migrated east until they reached Vermont, where a significant population has been established. Many wildlife naturalists consider this coyote-wolf hybrid to be one of the most adaptable species that they have ever studied. Coy-Wolves survive, even thrive, in an extraordinarily wide range of natural and man-made habitats, kind of like Native Americans.<BR><BR> I first encountered Coy-Wolves around the turn of the new millennium, as we began staying in a small cabin on our land while our house was built. We were often greeted at night by the howls of what we then understood to be &ldquo;the coyotes.&rdquo; It never occurred to us that the night visitors were actually greeting us, and reminding interlopers whose territory this was. We knew that coyotes communicated with one another, but we did not yet know how to listen, to really listen. <BR><BR>Everything changed with my mother&rsquo;s death and the kind mentoring and guidance of cousins more versed in our tribal culture than I. Consequently, more recently we were prepared both to listen and to understand our encounters with Coy-Wolves as part of a process of awakening. <BR><BR>On a moon-lit night in January 2018, we were watching a segment of a video-course on Native Americans. The documentary&rsquo;s historical segments resonated most deeply as they dealt, in depth, with our Potawatomi tribe and its history in the upper Midwest, its forced evacuations and deadly marches westward, its legacy of countless broken treaties. <BR><BR>This kind of intellectual-emotional onslaught through story-telling was leaving us drained every night after watching each new episode of the history series and reflecting on its meaning. The narrator, Professor Daniel Cobb, repeatedly claims that Native Americans have not disappeared. He argues that despite continual miserable betrayals and ignominious defeats and slaughter, Native peoples found ways of adapting and maintaining some continuity, even as many of their lands and cultural practices were taken away, even as they intermarried with whites and assimilated elements of European culture. <BR><BR>Each night this historical conundrum of devastation and revival returned to me in the form of profoundly personal questions and reflection. As we ended our most recent viewing, Carolyn and I went downstairs to play cards in an attempt to get our minds off the perplexing questions, and to regain our composure. <BR><BR>No sooner had we dealt the cards than we noticed the howls. THE HOWLS. Even on a freezing Vermont winter night with doors and windows buttoned-up, the sounds of our visitors came through the walls. The Coy-Wolves were closer than ever. Our visitors demanded attention. But, &ldquo;What were they saying?&rdquo; I wondered. The howls continued for quite some time. <BR><BR>Somewhat shaken, I went to bed reflecting on the documentary and the visitations. Then, as is so often the case, the answer came in the middle of the night. It was as if a message buried in the historical documentary&rsquo;s storyline had clarified, had then been downloaded into my consciousness, and was churning, seeking expression. It hit me. I am a &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; like the Coy-Wolf. And like the Coy-Wolves in Vermont, I am many generations removed from my &ldquo;pure-blood&rdquo; ancestors. Like the Coy-Wolf, I am not a lesser being for the dilution of my ancestral blood lines. I am an evolutionary manifestation of adaptation. <BR><BR>And then another personal and intimate connection emerged. I began to visualize the migratory routes of southwestern coyotes as they slowly moved north-eastward in the 19th century, in the exact opposite direction, and in the same time frame that many of my ancestors were being physically driven out of their homelands and off one temporary reservation after another. I also saw the paths of those small numbers of Potawatomi who had escaped from these forced death marches and who had fled to Canada, where their descendants live today. Then, I wondered if the spirits of my ancestors forced westward, of those driven into the desert, had journeyed northward, back home, and then to Canada? Had they cleverly done so in an animal form that no white man would recognize as human, and in a manner that no soldiers could prevent? Were the Coy-Wolves outside my door the embodiment of my ancestors&rsquo; wandering spirits?<BR><BR> I think so. <BR><BR>I now hope that I will be worthy of more visitations. I hope that I will be better able to listen to the wisdom they bear. I hope that like Coy-Wolf I can be the conveyor and restorer of my dual heritages, made stronger, not lessened, by the blending.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[&ldquo;<I>Without Reservation</I> is a wonderful representation of the personal struggles Native American people often find themselves in. The conflicts between societal viewpoints and self-determination cause many to evaluate and reevaluate themselves on a continuous basis. There are often internal power struggles between the European viewpoints of what an Indian should be and the mirror of our ancestors that shows us who we are--by our mere existence. We are all subconsciously drawn to communications from the spirits of our ancestors, the environment, and the animal and plant relatives. We only have to open our ears, hearts, and minds to receive these messages from the great web of life.&rdquo;]]></d104>

He explains how people throughout the centuries have built a relationship with the elemental energies around them using simple, everyday practices in order to attune themselves to nature, the seasons, and the cosmos for magical purposes. <BR><BR>The author explores earth, mineral, and plant magic as well as the magical properties of the earth&rsquo;s cycles and concentrated places of power within the landscape. He examines magical workings with animals, drawing on authentic traditions such as the Toadsmen or Toadswomen, whose power is given by toads, and the Berserker qualities conferred by magical bondings with wild animals like bears and wolves. He explains how to craft your own magical talismans, wands, and divining rods; design your own ceremonies; practice elemental meditations; fortify your health with herbs and crystals; and set an altar with the right food and drink for your intention. <BR><BR>Pennick also describes how the practical techniques of natural elemental magic work through interactions between the inner world of the mind and spirit, the outer world, and the otherworldly. He shows that having a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of all things and the inner power of these magical elements strengthens the practitioner&rsquo;s harmony with nature, and thus their power. By harnessing the elemental energies around us, we can work with nature for personal development, spiritual empowerment, and the successful achievement of our desires]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<B>From Chapter 5. The Power Within <BR></B><BR>As part of traditional spirituality, natural magic respects the creative life force in all things. According to the natural magical worldview, being human does not give us the right to dominate and destroy nature. Rather, it teaches us to be mindful that all things are interconnected, that polar opposites are actually two sides of the same unity. Meditation on this leads us to a new understanding of our human existence, for without this worldview, we cannot work natural magic. <BR><BR><B><I>Might and Main</I></B> <BR><BR>Traditionally, the powers of the body are seen as embodied in two separate but linked qualities: might and main. Might is the physical strength of the body: the energy within it that enables it to live, powering its movements and actions. Main is the inner strength that empowers the personality. Without main, might is useless, for main includes the will to live. It is main that enables a person to exert his or her will in all realms of life. It empowers the magical arts of the human being. We must have both might and main in order to live effectively. Without one or the other, we are close to death. <BR><BR><B><I>Empowerment</I></B> <BR><BR>Natural magic enables us to fully utilize our might and main in a creative way through spiritual empowerment. Spiritual empowerment is the harmonization of the body and mind with the all-encompassing power of the cosmos. It can be achieved by means of spiritual exercises that bring the functions of body and mind into alignment with each other, and then into alignment with eternal forces. There are five stages in the spiritual exercises of natural magic, as follows. <BR><BR>First, sit in an alert, yet relaxed position, either with legs crossed, or with the legs beneath the body. Next, regulate the breath. Once the breath is under control, regular and slow, banish all unwanted thoughts. This is not easy for the beginner. Firstly, by closing your eyes, withdraw your attention from all external objects and distractions. Suppress inner mental images, too. Then, let your bodily sensations gradually fade and become unimportant. <BR><BR>It is possible to banish unwanted thoughts by concentrating on a specific thought, perhaps the visualization of a symbol. This can be something spiritual that has personal meaning. Use it regularly, and it will become part of your consciousness. <BR><BR>Once you are in a meditative state, then the next step is sound, in the form of chant or song. The sacramental energy present in words is recognized throughout the world. An appropriate chant, spell, or song that comes from within will raise that energy and empower the singer. Once the activity is finished, there must be a re-awakening, a re-entry to the everyday world. This is accomplished in the reverse order, consciously bringing each part of the body and mind back to &ldquo;normality.&rdquo; The body, as well as the mind, will feel revitalized at the end of the process, giving us a greater awareness of our surroundings, and our creative possibilities. <BR><BR><B><I>Elemental Alignment</I></B> <BR><BR>A good way of gaining bodily and mental familiarity with the four material elements, and the fifth non-material one, is to use them in meditation. Like other magical activities, you should perform these meditations inside a protective boundary. Each time you work with an element, use the same technique. Begin with the densest element, Earth, then proceed to the lightest, Fire, in the sequence Earth, Water, Air, Fire. <BR><BR><B>Earth Meditation.</B> Put some earth in a ceramic or glass bowl, and place it in a convenient location. Sit in a meditational posture, and focus your attention on the earth in the bowl. Explore in your mind the many possibilities of earth symbolized by this small sample. When you have done this, allow your consciousness to enter the earth. Become at one with it. Experience its heaviness, its many variant forms and possibilities, and the feelings that they bring. <BR><BR><B>Water Meditation.</B> Pour some natural spring or well water into a bowl, and place the bowl in a convenient location, as before. Focus your meditation upon the water. Explore the many forms of water: wetness, rain, streams, puddles, lakes, and the sea. When you have done this, allow your consciousness to enter the water. Become at one with it. Experience its fluidity, its many variant flowing possibilities, and the feelings that they bring you. <BR><BR><B>Air Meditation.</B> Light some incense. It is best to use one that you have collected yourself, such as resin from a tall conifer. Burn it on charcoal in a fireproof dish. Place the dish in a convenient place, as before. Then focus your meditation upon the smoke that indicates the invisible air. Explore the many forms of air: the atmosphere of places, breezes, winds, storms, hurricanes, and whirlwinds. When you have done this, allow your consciousness to enter the air. Become at one with it. Experience its freedom and motion, and the feelings that they bring.<BR><BR><B>Fire Meditation.</B> For this, light a candle, using struck fire. It is best to use a fire-colored one, deep orange or red. Watch the brilliant flame, and focus your awareness upon the qualities and forms of fire and flame: heat, flickering light, red-hot metal, volcanic eruptions, and the power of the sun. Then imagine yourself as part of the fire, experiencing the feelings that this generates. <BR><BR><B>The Subtle Power Meditation.</B> Sit as before, visualizing the natural empowerment of all existence, the flowing energy matrix upon which all things are patterned. Envisage it as ever-changing, flowing geometrical colors and forms, like the rainbow patterns on the surface of a bubble. <BR><BR>When you have finished each meditation, direct your consciousness away from the object. Return to a full awareness of the things around you. When you begin, it is best to work several times with each element, until you feel ready to move on to the next one. Once you have worked through all five, you will find that your understanding of the subtle realms has been greatly empowered.]]></d104>

Taking readers step-by-step through the nine energetic levels of dying, author Suzanne Worthley explains what is happening at each level or dimension energetically, what to watch for in each stage, and specific ways in which we can support our loved ones through their transition back to spirit. For each of the nine stages, she describes what the dying person may see and experience, including the stages of transition at which people undergo the familiar elements of near-death experiences, such as entering a tunnel, conducting a life review, or encountering angels, guides, loved ones in spirit, or a bright light. She explores what family members and friends may see and experience, such as spirit energy, and what they can do to offer practical support and emotional solace to their loved one. <BR><BR>Examining how life force energy works as well as what Akashic records and soul contracts are, Worthley shares hospice case studies for each level of transition, so caregivers can see how belief systems and energy blocks in specific chakras affect the death process and why it is important to clear energy blocks like fear, anger, or guilt during life if possible. She explores the grieving process and offers helpful strategies for moving through it as well as &ldquo;at-a-glance&rdquo; reference tables of the nine stages and related healing strategies designed to be referred to by those holding vigil. <BR><BR>Shedding light on one of the great mysteries of existence, <I>An Energy Healer&rsquo;s Book of Dying</I> offers a compact yet comforting guide to support you through this emotional, grief-filled, and exhausting time and help you bring solace to your loved one during the transition back to spirit.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<B>Introduction </B><BR><BR>I grew up as the daughter of a mortician. As a child, I never thought of my father&rsquo;s job as different or odd. Actually, I never really thought about it at all. My mother stayed home to raise my five siblings and me, while my father spent his days working in the funeral home. For some, a funeral home can be an uncomfortable place, but for me, it was a second home. I spent every Saturday there after piano lessons. It was my father&rsquo;s office. It was where we hung out. It was a normal part of life--just like riding in the hearse. For some, a hearse represents dread and sorrow, but for me it was our family car, which could easily tote around six children. <BR><BR>Later on, I learned my upbringing wasn&rsquo;t all that conventional. Most kids didn&rsquo;t talk about death and dying at the dinner table alongside the usual topics of school, grades, and boyfriends. It wasn&rsquo;t until high school when I noticed a difference in the way my friends thought about death. I admit I could cause quite a stir in a group of teenagers when they found out I was a mortician&rsquo;s daughter. Even today, I still find most folks are uncomfortable with the subject of dying. I personally never thought of death as something scary, icky, or weird. I certainly didn&rsquo;t perceive my father working with death as something scary, icky, or weird. I believed then (and now) that death is simply part of our life path. It is not to be feared as much as embraced. Even as a child, I intuitively knew that any professional who assisted the loved ones left behind during their loved one&rsquo;s journey of &ldquo;going home&rdquo; must be a person with a <I>gift</I>. My father has that gift, and he chose to share it with others. As an energy practitioner, spiritual healer, and hospice volunteer, I have had the opportunity to use this gift and spend numerous hours with people during what I feel is one of the most profound energetic and spiritual experiences ever--<I>their death</I>. I have witnessed firsthand, through the use of my psychic abilities and knowledge of our human energy systems, their incredible journey back to spirit. My hospice patients are so loving and giving of themselves. They are my teachers. Their homes and hospital rooms are my classrooms. I'm blessed they allow me to share such a personal, spiritual time and space, and I feel it is time to finally share what I have learned to help people through their own personal journey, whether they are the patient, the family member, the loved one, the friend, or the medical staff. <BR><BR>Doing this work has allowed me to find a unique perspective on how the soul processes and works in energy. I want to share firsthand what I see and offer you a new way to look at death <I>using psychic sight</I>. When we look at death only with our human eyes, we are often consumed by fear and sadness. But when we understand how to use <I>psychic sight</I>, we can move through the process in love and spirit. There are many who do not necessarily view the process of death as a gift, and I understand it can be a hard concept to understand. That is why I wrote this tiny book: to replace fear with knowledge. To encourage willing participation. To give power back to those who own it. To affirm miracles. To help people see through the perspective of the heart rather than the limited perspective of the ego. <BR><BR>This book is divided into two sections. In the first, I give some helpful background information: a description of how life force energy works, what the Akashic records and soul contracts are, and an overview of the energetic stages of the death process. In the second section, we&rsquo;ll go step-by-step through the nine energetic levels of dying, so you can understand what is happening at each level, know what to watch for in each stage, and learn specific ways in which you can support your loved one through their transition back to spirit. Additionally, I have included actual hospice visits as case studies so that you can see how others have experienced the stages of death in various ways. These case studies examine, on an energetic level, the experiences some hospice patients have had while shutting down specific chakras. I share these to assist you in seeing how energy blocks can affect the death process. Again, my goal is to help you to understand and clear the fears in life because they will indeed affect the death process. <BR><BR>You do not have to be psychic to have experiences similar to those you will read on the pages ahead. Anyone who has assisted a loved one, friend, or patient through the death process has most likely come into contact with some, or all, of the phases involved. Without the knowledge of what they are experiencing, the events are often dismissed or downplayed. Many find themselves doubting what they actually saw or felt as they walked with a loved one through the death process. The feelings in the room. The sensation of spiritual visitors. The shifting movement of light. The <I>coincidences</I> of how things and timing played out. By learning the phases of the journey to spirit, we can embrace the stages in a new light--one of divine energy. <BR><BR>Just like my father used his gift to help families after the death process, my purpose is to offer perspectives to help the dying person and his or her family members and friends move through the death process with love. I do not in any way mean to impose my vision on others. Death is personal, private, and probably one of the more sacred occurrences we encounter, either for our self or our loved ones. I only offer my perspective as a gift of sharing.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA["In this book, Suzanne Worthley helps us to understand not just from a physical perspective but from a spiritual/energetic perspective just what an amazing journey the dying go through as the soul leaves form and travels home. Suzanne writes with the passion of one who has first-hand experience of having watched with the dying. I hear the truth in her words regarding unfinished business, 'As a soul, we will still need to do the work whether we are on this side of the veil or not.' This encourages us to integrate our shadows here and now whilst still embodied. She further comforts us with the words, 'We are all born from love. We are all made from love. We have the ability to return to love.' Thank you, Suzanne, you have served us well in sharing your wisdom of death and dying.&rdquo;]]></d104>

Aptly known in popular culture as &ldquo;Ecstasy,&rdquo; MDMA helps us rediscover our own true loving nature, often obscured by the traumas of life. On its way to becoming a prescription medication due to groundbreaking research on its use to treat PTSD, Ecstasy can offer benefits for all adult life stages, from 20-somethings to seniors. <BR><BR>In this memoir and guide to safe use, Charles Wininger, a licensed psychoanalyst and mental health counselor, details the countless ways that Ecstasy has helped him become a better therapist and husband. He recounts his coming of age in the 1960s counterculture, his 50 years of responsible experimentation with mind-altering substances, and his immersion in the new psychedelic renaissance. He explains how he and his wife found Ecstasy to be the key to renewing and enriching their lives as they entered their senior years. It also strengthened the bonds of their marriage. <BR><BR>Countering the fearful propaganda that surrounds this drug, Wininger describes what the experience actually feels like and explores the value of Ecstasy and similar substances for helping psychologically healthy individuals live a more &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; life. He provides protocols for the responsible, recreational, and celebrational use of MDMA, including how to perfect the experience, maximize the benefits and minimize the risks, and how it may not be for everyone. He reveals how MDMA has revitalized his marriage, both erotically and emotionally, and describes how pleasure, fun, and joy can be profound bonding and transformative experiences. <BR><BR>Revealing MDMA&rsquo;s versatility when it comes to bringing lasting renewal, pleasure, and inspiration to one&rsquo;s life, Wininger shows that recognizing the transformative power of happiness-inducing experiences can be the first step on the path to healing.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<B>From the Prologue</B><BR><BR>When I find myself on fire in my life to the point where I start approaching burnout, I&rsquo;ve learned to follow an old adage: Stop, drop, and roll. <BR><BR>I carve out time, usually a week or two in advance, to stop my life&rsquo;s merry-go-round for a day, drop some MDMA, and the &ldquo;roll&rdquo; (meaning, the MDMA experience) replenishes my being. <BR><BR>I call this responsible recreational drug use. The very notion may sound counter-intuitive to the reader&rsquo;s acculturated ears, as it once did to mine. But for the community I&rsquo;ve discovered and that my wife Shelley and I have helped nurture over the past fifteen years here in New York, the responsible middle way (between abstention and abuse) is the way to a fuller life. We&rsquo;ve found that having a mature and fact-based approach to using MDMA to be of enormous benefit to ourselves. (See chapter 8: &ldquo;Guidelines for the Responsible Recreational Use of MDMA.&rdquo;)<BR><BR>Potentially one of the world&rsquo;s most beneficial psychoactive chemicals, and one that almost always bestows a secret smile upon its users, MDMA is a much maligned and misunderstood compound often slandered by a media always hot for another scare-the-pants-off-the-parents story.<BR><BR>But in fact, MDMA is a sheep in wolf&rsquo;s clothing. An angel depicted with horns. It&rsquo;s an exotic chemical with a devoted esoteric following, and its benefits are a well-kept open secret. Indeed, the closer one gets to MDMA, the better it looks. In its pure form, and when used responsibly, it remains practically impossible to O.D. on. <BR><BR>What makes MDMA an uncanny compound is its versatility: It has been shown in clinical trials to bring profound and lasting relief to those suffering from PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stess Disorder) such as victims of sexual violence and traumatized soldiers back from Iraq. Or it can help a couple trying to reclaim the lost heart of their relationship. And this same substance at the same dosage can be used at an all-night rave to dance ecstatically with a thousand others in unified, wild abandon. Is there another substance on the planet that can claim such a range of applications? <BR><BR><B>From Chapter 6. Senior High<BR><BR><I>Youth Serum</I></B> <BR><BR>If you happen to be of the older persuasion, do you remember the moment you crossed over? I know I do. I must have been in my early 50s and was about to get on a Manhattan cross town bus. I dug into my pocket, took out my change (this was before Metrocards), and started depositing quarters into the machine. After dropping the first three in, the driver immediately stretched out his hand to cover the opening. <BR><BR><I>&ldquo;No one&rsquo;s going to question you!&rdquo;</I> he said. <BR><BR>Huh? <BR><BR>Then I noticed the listed fares: Standard ride: $1.50. Seniors: $.75. <BR>Wait! I thought. I want to be questioned! I want to be proofed on this end! <BR><BR>It&rsquo;s taken me a while to adjust. Indeed, I&rsquo;m still getting used to it. But then again, I&rsquo;ve had a medicinal advantage. <BR><BR>Because when I roll, the world seems made new again. (Of course, that would be me that&rsquo;s made new.) In this and other ways, MDMA has helped me adjust to and deal with aging and mortality. And it&rsquo;s given me, up here in my early seventies, a new lease on youth. For a few hours, this world-weary mind and aging body are reinvigorated. As long as I use it wisely, I can return to the fresh vitality of my 30- or even 20-year-old self for a few hours, a brief vacation in Youthlandia. I&rsquo;m free and reborn with an innocent, fresh-off-the-boat feeling. And with my wife Shelley by my side, we experience a unique attunement together, two kids, hand in hand, skipping around our chemical playground. <BR><BR>Over the years, she and I and others in our community have turned responsible use of this recreational drug into a science as well as an art form, transforming what could otherwise be a dangerous indulgence into a tool that continuously brings joy and vitality to our senior years. <BR><BR>This is my fountain of youth. It doesn&rsquo;t last, of course; I do come down, and have to pay an energy debt (mostly I just sleep it off and then rest the next day). But there&rsquo;s nothing like once again experiencing in my bones the vitality I used to take for granted. I feel rejuvenated in a way that can echo for days. And over the course of years and dozens of rolls, this has had a cumulative effect. Further, remembering how good I can feel in every way helps infuse me with the kind of optimism that can otherwise tend to wane with age. <BR><BR>As Anais Nin said, we don&rsquo;t see things as they are; we see things as <I>we</I> are. This medicine freshens my outlook and my inlook. <BR><BR>While I may therefore lament, as many of us do, that I didn&rsquo;t know then all I know now, at least with MDMA I can still know now some of the youthful vitality I knew back then. <BR><BR>To put it another way, the first time around, youth chose me. The second time, I make the choice. For Shelley and me, MDMA used properly has become our youth serum.<BR><BR>The Japanese have a word for this, <I>kanreki</I>, which means second spring. <BR><BR>Besides blessing me with a daylong vacation from aging, the medicine also helps me reconnect with my love for mankind. And these days, I don&rsquo;t take this for granted.<BR><BR>I view MDMA as an egalitarian opportunity for joy and rejuvenation, one whose availability is not limited to the spiritual, the wealthy&hellip; or the young. No matter one&rsquo;s class, age, gender, race, or sexuality, a person can take charge of their own chemistry, and potentially their whole worldview as well. And after having spent a lifetime following mainstream advice about how to add years to my life, I&rsquo;ve decided to spend my remaining time following my own advice about how to add life to my years.]]></d104>

In this love poem to MDMA, Charley personalizes a substance that many only know through research reports of MDMA&rsquo;s tremendous healing potential. As a trusted elder in the psychedelic community, he shares his wisdom about how to maximize the lifeenhancing potential of MDMA while minimizing risk. In coming out of the closet as a &lsquo;responsible recreational drug user,&rsquo; he &lsquo;roll&rsquo; models the courage to live authentically. He challenges prohibition and the demonization of drugs, arguing for personal liberation. He argues for our right to decide on the chemistry and cognitive liberty within, rather than be at the mercy of the forces of social control. Wininger also shows us how, at any age, we can live ecstatically, sexually, and joyfully, balancing and celebrating life and having extraordinary and serious fun along the way. Finally, Charley invites us to join him and his welcoming psychedelic community in connection and love. This delightful book left me feeling inspired to create a more fulfilling life and feeling hopeful for humanity.&rdquo; Andrew Tatarsky, Ph.D., founder and]]></d104>

From the moment of birth--even in the womb--every word, thought, or sound we encounter is important and powerful, nourishing or toxic. When we understand the powerful effects of sound and vibration, we can consciously apply them for our health and well-being. <BR><BR>In this practical and accessible guide, Erica Longdon explains the therapeutic and healing impact of sound, frequency, and vibration on the body, mind, and spirit. She shows how sound therapy triggers the body&rsquo;s natural self-healing mechanisms and offers a non-invasive way to permeate every cell of the body with healing intentions. She presents a wide range of sound-healing methods and vibrational practices and explores tools such as tuning forks, gongs, singing bowls, drumming, chakra chants, and angelic vibrations as well as cymatics--the study of wave phenomena, which makes sound visible. She explains how to use different sound healing methods and offers instructions both for self-treatment and as preparation if you go see a sound therapist. She reveals how each of us has a sound healing tool at our disposal--our own voice--and provides simple practices and exercises such as humming, vowel toning, and affirmations that you can begin using right away for self-healing. She also explores the power of silence and how even our inner vibrations--thoughts and intentions--affect us sonically and can be used for vibrational healing. <BR><BR>Offering a natural way to treat pain and illness, this guide gives you the tools to connect with your inner healer, restore balance and harmony, and harness the power of vibration for sound health.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<B>From chapter &ldquo;VITAMIN M&rdquo; <BR><BR>&bull; &ldquo;M&rdquo; <BR>&bull; MANTRA <BR>&bull; MUSIC<BR><BR>&ldquo;M</B>&rdquo; <BR><BR>M is the supreme consonant. Humming &ldquo;M&rdquo; is the antidote to anxiety. M is the sound of yourself. M draws you inward to the point of inner peace. M is the opposite of ego. Humming is especially useful if you are &ldquo;shamed&rdquo; about your voice and find singing or chanting challenging to try. Internationally renowned sound healers Jonathan and Andi Goldman have recently written an entire book on humming: <I>The Humming Effect</I>, in which they explore the science behind the many spiritual and therapeutic effects of this self-administered therapy. Ritually, the sound of humming, MMMM is found at the end of OM, AMEN, and many of the other sacred seed syllables (see Vitamin V - vowels). We even make a humming sound when we make a discovery or find ourselves in agreement with another&rsquo;s statement. It is a life-affirming sound. <BR><BR><B>MANTRA <BR></B><BR>Mantra is a Sanskrit word which means: &ldquo;that which protects and purifies the mind&rdquo;. It can be more simply translated as: &ldquo;man&rdquo; = mind and &ldquo;tra&rdquo; = tool. Mind is intended in the broadest sense of thoughts, and the emotions associated with them. <BR><BR>The sacred sound of the mantra contains &ldquo;seeds&rdquo; (bija syllables in Sanskrit - see Vitamin V: Vowels). These syllables, when repeated, take seed in the mind and act as a catalyst for change. <BR><BR>Mantras can be vocal or mental. Whereas chanting eventually requires vocal engagement, a mantra is designed to work internally as much as externally. When done inwardly, with just the mind, no note or tone is necessary, just a steady rhythm. This is a useful practice to cultivate as it can be called upon at any time and in any situation to gain calm, balance, and objectivity, especially if our thoughts and emotions are running away with us. <BR><BR>Mantra can be described as sound forms of the consciousness--or divine if you prefer that term. All the major wisdom traditions speak of this. They teach that the power of mantra, if used regularly over time, will take you into clarity and awareness, wholeness, or holistic resonance. Mantra is sometimes accompanied by the use of a mala, a circle of 108 beads with an extra guru bead which is often offset and larger than the rest. This is so the fingers can find it when eyes are closed reciting the mantra. Some malas have a different shaped bead every 27th bead as a guide to where you are in the cycle. A mantra is said for each bead. Fingering the beads while chanting a mantra, either silently or vocally, helps to keep a steady rhythm and thus control and slow breathing. <BR><BR>When we realize the power that sound has in the universe, then it follows that this practice is a wonderful tool for healing when unleashed with intent into our consciousness. <BR><BR>Although we are probably most familiar with Sanskrit mantras, sacred words exist in many languages: Hebrew, Arabic, and other languages. Your own name is a wonderful mantra (see Vitamin N). <BR><BR>Using mantra takes us from the outside world, to our inner awareness and deep into the subtle layers of the mind. When we engage with our inner world, far from contracting, we can experience a vast openness and clarity. Our perception has far more room in this great inner space, than in the thought clogged thoroughfares of our external consciousness in daily life. <BR><BR><B>WAYS TO TAKE VITAMIN M <BR><BR><I>MANTRA</I></B> <BR><BR>When you decide to spend time working with a mantra, preparation will bring great reward. <BR><BR>Take time to go into a quiet place where you will not be disturbed and there is not background noise. If you want to be vocal and chant, you need free airways, so standing is ideal, or sitting with erect spine to allow the abdomen to expand. Center yourself by taking some long, slow breaths and exhaling fully. Think about your intention. What do you hope to achieve? <BR><BR>Before making any vocal sound, focus on the sound you wish to produce. It might be spoken, chanted on one note, or it may be a more complex mantra with a tune. Hear it inside you. Allow the intent to fill you, pushing away outside interference. <BR><BR>Starting chanting silently. When you are ready, after thirty seconds or so, you may begin to vocalize the mantra. When you have finished, diminish the mantra to internal. Finally, release the chant, rest, and maintain silence for at least a minute. It is preferable to spend double the time in silence at the end than you did in the beginning. When working with vibration and sound, much of the healing takes place once the resonance has died away and the effect is internalized (Vitamin S, silence). This is also true of tuning forks (see Vitamin F). <BR><BR>Which mantra to choose? We have already met one of the major and most popular mantras, Om Mani Padme Hum under Vitamin C, chanting. If you have found some proficiency in working with breath (vitamin B) and toning on a single note for chakra tuning (vitamin C), you may feel it is time to intake some of the more complex mantras.<BR><BR><I>A mantra is a much more complex concept than a mere chant because it is a tool to unite sound, body, mind and soul in a deeply philosophical or spiritual experience.</I><BR><BR>There are a great many to choose from. Below I have picked three mantras which are among my favorites and hold powerful transformational possibilities. In your preparation you could choose to dedicate your mantra to a situation in the world. Never think you are too small to make a difference. You are far more powerful than you think.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[A clinical psychiatrist explores the effects of DMT, one of the most powerful psychedelics known. <BR><BR>&bull; A behind-the-scenes look at the cutting edge of psychedelic research. <BR><BR>&bull; Provides a unique scientific explanation for the phenomenon of alien abduction experiences. <BR><BR>From 1990 to 1995 Dr. Rick Strassman conducted U.S. Government-approved and funded clinical research at the University of New Mexico in which he injected sixty volunteers with DMT, one of the most powerful psychedelics known. His detailed account of those sessions is an extraordinarily riveting inquiry into the nature of the human mind and the therapeutic potential of psychedelics. DMT, a plant-derived chemical found in the psychedelic Amazon brew, ayahuasca, is also manufactured by the human brain. In Strassman's volunteers, it consistently produced near-death and mystical experiences. Many reported convincing encounters with intelligent nonhuman presences, aliens, angels, and spirits. Nearly all felt that the sessions were among the most profound experiences of their lives. <BR><BR>Strassman's research connects DMT with the pineal gland, considered by Hindus to be the site of the seventh chakra and by Rene Descartes to be the seat of the soul. DMT: The Spirit Molecule makes the bold case that DMT, naturally released by the pineal gland, facilitates the soul's movement in and out of the body and is an integral part of the birth and death experiences, as well as the highest states of meditation and even sexual transcendence. Strassman also believes that "alien abduction experiences" are brought on by accidental releases of DMT. If used wisely, DMT could trigger a period of remarkable progress in the scientific exploration of the most mystical regions of the human mind and soul.]]></d104>

Strassman&rsquo;s research points toward a physiological basis for spirit and its interaction with the human body; his data suggests that our brain chemistry allows us access to other realms of existence just when we need it most, and his story recounts both the dangers and promises of entering this brave new world.&rdquo;]]></d104>

During the storm, a medical waste container has washed up on the beach. Inside are two decomposed bodies wrapped in plastic sheeting and bound with electrical wire. Chillingly, Tempe recognizes many details as identical to those of an unsolved case she handled in Quebec fifteen years earlier. With a growing sense of foreboding, she flies to Montreal to gather evidence and convince her boss Pierre LaManch to reopen the cold case. She also seeks the advice&#8212;and comfort&#8212;of her longtime beau Andrew Ryan.<BR> <BR> Meanwhile, a storm of a different type gathers force in South Carolina. The citizens of Charleston are struck by a bacterium that, at its worst, can eat human flesh. Thousands panic and test themselves for a rare genetic mutation that may have rendered them vulnerable.<BR> <BR> Shockingly, Tempe eventually discovers that not only are the victims in both grisly murder cases related, but that the murders and the disease outbreak also have a common cause&hellip;&#8203;&#8203;]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[When the relationship Judith Lucy thought was The One broke down, her world fell apart. Not only was she single again and about to turn fifty but now that she didn&rsquo;t have a partner to buy gourmet sausages with at Farmers' Markets, she realised how much her relationship had enabled her to avoid dealing with: everything from her brother&rsquo;s death to her doubts about doing comedy in an increasingly serious world situation.<BR> <BR>Why was she so floored? Did all these problems have something in common? Judith went back to the start to try and work that out.<BR> <BR>In her most candid and insightful book yet, Judith looks at her family and relationships to understand how despite being a feminist, her hopes and expectations have been shaped by men &#8211; whether it was thinking that she needed Mr Right to 'complete her' or struggling for male approval in most aspects of her life, including her work.<BR> <BR>Having diagnosed the disease, Judith sets about healing. She explores other ways to get outside herself and make the most of the time she has left &#8211; community, volunteering, climate action and the natural world. And although things will doubtless keep going wrong (like covid!), it turns out &hellip; she&rsquo;s fine.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>As the resourceful, relentless Li tracks her lost daughter across a disintegrating country, the journey will test the limits of her trust, her hope and her love. <i>Unsheltered</i> will leave you wrung out and gasping.</b><BR> <BR> Relentlessly propulsive and profoundly moving, <i>Unsheltered</i> taps into some of our worst fears and most implacable motivations, marking the emergence of a fully-formed and urgent literary voice.<BR> <BR> Against a background of social breakdown and destructive weather,<i> Unsheltered</i> tells the story of a woman&rsquo;s search for her daughter. Li never wanted to bring a child into a world like this but now that eight-year-old Matti is missing, she will stop at nothing to find her.<BR> <BR> As she crosses the great barren country alone and on foot, living on what she can find and fuelled by visions of her daughter just out of sight ahead, Li will have every instinct tested. She knows the odds against her: an uncompromising landscape, an indifferent system, time running out, and the risks of any encounters on the road. But the greatest obstacles of all might be her own uncertainty and the ghosts of her past. Because even if she finds her, how can she hope to shield Matti from what is to come?<BR> <BR> At times tender, at times terrifying, <i>Unsheltered </i>is an engrossing, unpredictable novel that keeps the reader in suspense all the way to the end. A brilliant feat of imagination that asks if our humanity is the only protection we have left, <i>Unsheltered</i> will affect you in ways a book hasn&rsquo;t done in years.<BR> <BR> '<i>Unsheltered</i> reads like a thriller, is utterly convincing in all its invention, and kept a hard hold of me from beginning to end.' <b>Elizabeth Knox</b><BR> <BR> 'Li is an unforgettable character, whose scars are as compelling as her extraordinary resourcefulness - she powers an urgent, heart-stopping novel.' <b>Emily Perkins</b><BR> <BR> <b>'</b><i>Unsheltered</i> is a fist-clenching, breath-holding, heart-accelerating reading experience. Clare Moleta writes with clarity and force, conjuring a terrifyingly real world of environmental desolation and bureaucratic mercilessness, but also, vitally, one in which empathy, love and hope stubbornly persist. In temperamentally tenacious and teeth-grittingly tough Li, Moleta has created a heroine who is utterly believable in both her ambivalence about becoming a parent and in her single-minded determination to keep that child safe.' <b>Emily Maguire</b>]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<B>A fascinating exploration of the intricacies of how we remember, why we forget, and what we can do to protect our memories, from the Harvard-trained neuroscientist and bestselling author of </B><I><B>Still Alice.</B></I><BR><BR> Have you ever felt a crushing wave of panic when you can&rsquo;t for the life of you remember the name of that actor in the movie you saw last week, or you walk into a room only to forget why you went there in the first place? If you&rsquo;re over forty, you&rsquo;re probably not laughing. You might even be worried that these lapses in memory could be an early sign of Alzheimer&rsquo;s or dementia. In reality, for the vast majority of us, these examples of forgetting are completely normal. Why? Because while memory is amazing, it is far from perfect. Our brains aren&rsquo;t designed to remember every name we hear, plan we make, or day we experience. Just because your memory sometimes fails doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s broken or succumbing to disease. Forgetting is actually part of being human.<BR><BR> In <I>Remember</I>, neuroscientist and acclaimed novelist Lisa Genova delves into how memories are made and how we retrieve them. You&rsquo;ll learn whether forgotten memories are temporarily inaccessible or erased forever and why some memories are built to exist for only a few seconds (like a passcode) while others can last a lifetime (your wedding day). You&rsquo;ll come to appreciate the clear distinction between normal forgetting (where you parked your car) and forgetting due to Alzheimer&rsquo;s (that you own a car). And you&rsquo;ll see how memory is profoundly impacted by meaning, emotion, sleep, stress, and context. Once you understand the language of memory and how it functions, its incredible strengths and maddening weaknesses, its natural vulnerabilities and potential superpowers, you can both vastly improve your ability to remember and feel less rattled when you inevitably forget. You can set educated expectations for your memory, and in doing so, create a better relationship with it. You don&rsquo;t have to fear it anymore. And that can be life-changing.<BR><BR> &lsquo;Using her expertise as a neuroscientist and her gifts as a storyteller, Genova explains the nuances of human memory. As with her previous books, this is an engaging and edifying read.&rsquo;<B> Steven Pinker, Johnstone Professor of Psychology, Harvard University, author of&#160;</B><I><B>How the Mind Works</B></I><BR><BR> &lsquo;No one writes more brilliantly about the connections between the brain, the mind, and the heart.&#160;<I>Remember</I>&#160;is a beautiful, fascinating, and important book about the mysteries of human memory&mdash;what it is, how it works, and what happens when it is stolen from us. A scientific and literary treat that you will not soon forget.&rsquo;<B> Daniel Gilbert, Edgar Pierce Professor of Psychology, Harvard University,&#160;</B><I><B>New York Times</B></I><B>&#160;bestselling author of&#160;</B><I><B>Stumbling on Happiness</B></I><BR><BR> &lsquo;In&#160;<I>Remember</I>, Lisa Genova provides easy-to-follow, no nonsense advice on how to maximize one of the greatest outputs of your brain&mdash;memory. But, more important, she also lets us know that while memory is a tremendous gift, the real&#160;<I>you</I>&#160;is much more than just what you can remember!&rsquo;<B> Rudolph E. Tanzi, PhD, professor of neurology, Harvard Medical School, coauthor of&#160;</B><I><B>The Healing Self&#160;</B></I>]]></d104>

That iconic group of ingenues and heart throbs, including Rob Lowe, Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez and Demi Moore, has come to represent both a genre of film and an era of pop culture.<BR> &#160;<BR> In <I>Brat</I>, McCarthy focuses his gaze on that singular moment in time and the most defining moments of his youth. The result is a revealing look at coming of age in a maelstrom, reckoning with conflicted ambition, innocence, addiction and expectations of masculinity. New York City of the 1980s is brought to vivid life, from scoring joints in Washington Square Park to skipping school in favour of the dark revival houses of the Village where he fell in love with the movies that would change his life.<BR> &#160;<BR><I>Brat&#160;</I>is at once an exclusive window into a defining period of pop-culture history and a surprising, intimate story of an outsider caught up in a most unwitting success.<BR><BR> &lsquo;Wit, wisdom, and a depth of honesty that resonates to your core&rsquo; <B>Demi Moore</B><BR><BR> &lsquo;Explores masculinity, success, the dangers of fame, ambition and cigarettes in an elegant and humorous coming of age story&rsquo; <B>Candace Bushnell</B><BR><BR> &lsquo;Absorbing, thoughtful, and sometimes painfully honest &hellip; a fascinating read&rsquo; <B>Jay McInerney</B><BR><BR> &lsquo;A riveting portrait of the artist as a young man&rsquo; <B><I>Publishers Weekly</I></B><BR> &#160;]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>From the intimate perspective of three friends and neighbors in mid-nineteenth century Auburn, New York&#8212;the &ldquo;agitators&rdquo; of the title&#8212;acclaimed author Dorothy Wickenden tells the fascinating and crucially American stories of abolition, the underground railroad, the early women&rsquo;s rights movement, and the Civil War. </b><BR><BR>Harriet Tubman&#8212;no-nonsense, funny, uncannily prescient, and strategically brilliant&#8212;was one of the most important conductors on the underground railroad and hid the enslaved men, women and children she rescued in the basement kitchens of Martha Wright, Quaker mother of seven, and Frances Seward, wife of Governor, then Senator, then Secretary of State William H. Seward.<BR> <BR>Harriet worked for the Union Army in South Carolina as a nurse and spy, and took part in a river raid in which 750 enslaved people were freed from rice plantations. Martha, a &ldquo;dangerous woman&rdquo; in the eyes of her neighbors and a harsh critic of Lincoln&rsquo;s policy on slavery, organized women&rsquo;s rights and abolitionist conventions with Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Frances gave freedom seekers money and referrals and aided in their education. The most conventional of the three friends, she hid her radicalism in public; behind the scenes, she argued strenuously with her husband about the urgency of immediate abolition.<BR> <BR>Many of the most prominent figures in the history books&#8212;Lincoln, Seward, Daniel Webster, Frederick Douglass, Charles Sumner, John Brown, Harriet Beecher Stowe, William Lloyd Garrison&#8212;are seen through the discerning eyes of the protagonists. So are the most explosive political debates: about women&rsquo;s roles and rights during the abolition crusade, emancipation, and the arming of Black troops; and about the true meaning of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.<BR> <BR>Beginning two decades before the Civil War, when Harriet Tubman was still enslaved and Martha and Frances were young women bound by law and tradition, <i>The Agitators</i> ends two decades after the war, in a radically changed United States. Wickenden brings this extraordinary period of our history to life through the richly detailed letters her characters wrote several times a week. Like Doris Kearns Goodwin&rsquo;s <i>Team of Rivals</i> and David McCullough&rsquo;s <i>John Adams</i>, Wickenden&rsquo;s <i>The Agitators </i>is revelatory, riveting, and profoundly relevant to our own time.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<i>This reading group guide for </i><b>The Agitators </b><i>includes an introduction, discussion questions, and ideas for enhancing your book club. The suggested questions are intended to help your reading group find interesting angles and topics for your discussion. We hope that these ideas will enrich your conversation and increase your enjoyment of the book.</i><BR><BR><b>Introduction</b><BR><BR>Dorothy Wickenden, the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Nothing Daunted</i>, once again brings historical figures vividly to life in <i>The Agitators</i>, a riveting dive into the lives of three unlikely collaborators in the quest for abolition and women&rsquo;s rights. By taking readers through the lives of these women&#8212;Harriet Tubman, Frances Seward, and Martha Wright&#8212;Wickenden offers an unusual and highly intimate perspective on the classic American stories of abolition, the underground railroad, women&rsquo;s rights activism, and the Civil War.<BR><BR><b>Topics & Questions for Discussion</b><BR><BR>1. Discuss the book&rsquo;s epigraph. How does this quote prepare you for the text? In what way does it resonate with current events?<BR><BR>2. The prologue and epilogue bookend the text with vivid descriptions of Fort Hill Cemetery today. What is the value of beginning and ending the book in this way? What effect does this have on your reading experience?<BR><BR>3. The first three chapters establish the very different backgrounds of Martha, Frances, and Harriet and the time in which they lived. What is your sense of their personalities and how they changed over time?<BR><BR>4. In chapter 4, Frances&rsquo;s husband, Henry, makes the extraordinarily controversial decision to defend William Freeman, the twenty-three-year-old Black man who confessed to murdering four members of a white family. This is one of the first uses of the insanity defense, which is based on the belief that a person who is unable to distinguish right from wrong should not be criminally charged because they cannot take moral responsibility for their crime. Henry&rsquo;s father-in-law, a county judge, thought his defense of Freeman would end his political career. Why was Frances so supportive of his choice?<BR><BR>5. In chapter 5, Martha overhears a party guest calling her &ldquo;a very dangerous woman&rdquo; because of her social activism and her friendship with Frederick Douglass. Consider what it meant to be a &ldquo;dangerous woman&rdquo; in Martha&rsquo;s time and place. Who, or what, is being threatened by Martha&rsquo;s behavior? Is there a modern-day equivalent of the term &ldquo;dangerous woman?&rdquo;<BR><BR>6. Discuss these two quotes from chapter 13 and how they have &ldquo;aged&rdquo; since their initial utterance: &ldquo;The United States government &lsquo;was made by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever.&rsquo;&rdquo; &#8212;Senator Stephen A. Douglas. &ldquo;I know, and you know, that a revolution has begun. I know, and all the world knows, that revolutions never go backward.&rdquo; &#8212;Senator William Henry Seward<BR><BR>7. Each of these women was bold, principled, and intent on changing the world. They express their idealism in different ways. Discuss the avenues and methods each used to try and affect change.<BR><BR>8. At the end of chapter 13, Henry and the British intellectual Harriet Martineau discuss slavery, &ldquo;the great American question.&rdquo; What might you consider today&rsquo;s &ldquo;great American question&rdquo;?<BR><BR>9. Harriet Tubman and her companions felt guided by their religious faith in pursuit of their activism, as did many reformers of the time, which often aided the progress of their causes. How was the political expression of evangelical thought different from how it is manifested today?<BR><BR>10. Harriet was an extraordinary orator and storyteller who, as the author says in chapter 15, knew how to play to &ldquo;her audiences&rsquo; enthusiasm for hair-raising first-person accounts of slavery and escape.&rdquo; What role does storytelling play throughout the book and in activism?<BR><BR>11. Throughout the book, we see Martha&rsquo;s roles as activist and mother intersect. In chapter 14, &ldquo;Martha Leads,&rdquo; we see this manifest in conflict with her daughter Ellen, who, according to the author, was &ldquo;overwhelmed by self-doubt&rdquo; and, &ldquo;to Martha&rsquo;s dismay,&rdquo; was &ldquo;more interested in her succession of suitors than in her studies.&rdquo; How does Martha&rsquo;s career as an activist seem to affect her daughter&rsquo;s development? What do you think of Martha&rsquo;s early reservations about becoming a leader and her own doubts about her capabilities? Do you see this conflict present in modern-day mother-daughter relationships?<BR><BR>12. Discuss the interplay of women&rsquo;s rights and anti-slavery activism throughout the book. The abolitionist and women&rsquo;s rights movement were aligned through much of the mid-nineteenth century. The movement split in the late 1860s over priorities&#8212;some women insisting that the fight for Black male suffrage take precedence over the fight for women&rsquo;s rights, while Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony broke away to fight solely for the women&rsquo;s vote. In what ways have the conflicts of this period extended to our own?<BR><BR>13. Think about the husbands of Martha, Frances, and Harriet. How did they help or hinder their wives in their sociopolitical goals? What impact did these relationships have on the women in their decision-making processes? How did the women shape the thinking and actions of their husbands?<BR><BR>14. Reflect on the Henry&rsquo;s long anti-slavery career, the battle between Frances and Henry in the early 1860s about immediate emancipation, and the ultimate assassination attempt on Henry and two of their sons. Martha blames Henry for Frances&rsquo;s unhappiness and, the author writes, finds him &ldquo;hungrier for power than for principle.&rdquo; What is your final assessment of Henry and of the difficulties of their marriage?<BR><BR>15. Letters, photos, and portraits appear throughout the book as chapter and section openers. What do these add to your reading experience? How does it feel to have faces and handwriting to put to these historical figures?<BR><BR>16. Consider the impact that the actions of the activists in the book may have had directly on your own life. Can you conjure an example of how their efforts in the movements benefited you personally?<BR><BR><b>Enhance Your Book Club</b><BR><BR>1. Check the National Register of Historic Places for historical sites near you. See what you can learn about your local history! <BR><BR>2. Correspond with your friends through handwritten letters about the book. This way, you might get a sense of what it was like to hold passionate discussions through snail mail as the women in the text did.<BR><BR>3. Brainstorm ways you might contribute to social activism today. Research causes that you are passionate about and take inspiration from Martha, Frances, and Harriet. Is there a local group you can participate in or online resources available in your area?]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>This riveting and uplifting memoir by Vanessa O&rsquo;Brien, record-breaking American-British explorer, takes you on an unexpected journey to the top of the world&rsquo;s highest mountains. </b><BR><BR>Long before she became the first American woman to summit K2 and the first British woman to return from its summit alive, Vanessa O&rsquo;Brien was a feisty suburban Detroit teenager forced to reinvent her world in the wake of a devastating loss that destroyed her family.<BR> <BR>Making her own way in the world, Vanessa strove to reach her lofty ambitions. Soon, armed with an MBA and a wry sense of humor, she climbed the corporate ladder to great success, but after the 2009 economic meltdown, her career went into a tailspin. She searched for a new purpose and settled on an unlikely goal: climbing Mount Everest. When her first attempt ended in disaster, she trudged home, humbled but wiser. Two years later, she made it to the top of the world. And then she kept going.<BR> <BR>Grounded by a cadre of wise-cracking friends and an inimitable British spouse, Vanessa held her own in the intensely competitive world of mountaineering, summiting the highest peak on every continent, and skiing the last degree to the North and South Poles. She set new speed records for the Seven Summits, receiving a Guinness World Record and the Explorers Grand Slam, and finally made peace with her traumatic past. During her attempt on K2, she very nearly gave up. But on the &ldquo;savage mountain,&rdquo; which kills one out of every four climbers who summit, Vanessa evolved from an adventurer out to challenge herself to an explorer with a high-altitude perspective on a changing world&#8212;and a new call to share her knowledge and passion across the globe.<BR> <BR>Told with heart and humor, Vanessa&rsquo;s journey from suburban Detroit to Everest&rsquo;s Death Zone to the summit of K2 and beyond, is a transformative story of resilience, higher purpose, and the courage to overcome any obstacle.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>In the tradition of <i>The Glass Castle</i>, a deeply felt memoir from Whiting Award&#8211;winner Nadia Owusu about the push and pull of belonging, the seismic emotional toll of family secrets, and the heart it takes to pull through.</b><BR> <BR><b>&ldquo;In <i>Aftershocks</i>, Nadia Owusu tells the incredible story of her young life. How does a girl&#8212;abandoned by her mother at age two and orphaned at thirteen when her beloved father dies&#8212;find her place in the world? This memoir is the story of Nadia creating her own solid ground across countries and continents. I know the struggle of rebuilding your life in an unfamiliar place. While some of you might be familiar with that and some might not, I hope you&rsquo;ll take as much inspiration and hope from her story as I did.&rdquo; <i>&#8212;</i>MALALA YOUSAFZAI </b><BR><BR>Young Nadia Owusu followed her father, a United Nations official, from Europe to Africa and back again. Just as she and her family settled into a new home, her father would tell them it was time to say their goodbyes. The instability wrought by Nadia&rsquo;s nomadic childhood was deepened by family secrets and fractures, both lived and inherited. Her Armenian American mother, who abandoned Nadia when she was two, would periodically reappear, only to vanish again. Her father, a Ghanaian, the great hero of her life, died when she was thirteen. After his passing, Nadia&rsquo;s stepmother weighed her down with a revelation that was either a bombshell secret or a lie, rife with shaming innuendo.<BR> <BR>With these and other ruptures, Nadia arrived in New York as a young woman feeling stateless, motherless, and uncertain about her future, yet eager to find her own identity. What followed, however, were periods of depression in which she struggled to hold herself and her siblings together.<BR> <BR><i>Aftershocks </i>is the way she hauled herself from the wreckage of her life&rsquo;s perpetual quaking, the means by which she has finally come to understand that the only ground firm enough to count on is the one written into existence by her own hand.<BR> <BR>Heralding a dazzling new writer, <i>Aftershocks</i> joins the likes of<i> Don&rsquo;t Let&rsquo;s Go to the Dogs Tonight</i> and William Styron&rsquo;s <i>Darkness Visible</i>, and does for race identity what Maggie Nelson does for gender identity in <i>The Argonauts.</i>]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[&quot;In this poignant memoir, author and narrator Nadia Owusu weaves an intricate narrative of home, belonging, trauma, family, geography, and the truths held in her Black female body. Using earthquakes as a metaphor to untangle the threads of her life, she recounts her childhood in Europe and Africa&mdash;a childhood defined by her mother&#39;s abandonment when she was a baby and her father&#39;s death when she was a teeanger. Her narration, like her prose, is raw and immediate. Sometimes rough and sometimes melodious, her ever-changing tone reflects a kaleidoscope of identity and experience. Her voice itself is a story, carrying both pain and joy. It is impossible to listen to this audiobook without hearing the power of Owusu&#39;s remaking of her world&mdash;and thus, our world&mdash;as she speaks.&quot;]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>From legendary wrestling announcer Jim Ross, this candid, colorful memoir about the inner workings of the WWE and the personal crises he weathered at the height of his career is &ldquo;a must-read for wrestling fans&rdquo; (<i>Charleston Post Courier</i>).</b><BR><BR>If you&rsquo;ve caught a televised wrestling match anytime in the past thirty years, you&rsquo;ve probably heard Jim Ross&rsquo;s throaty Oklahoma twang. The beloved longtime announcer of the WWE &ldquo;has been a driving force behind a generation of wrestling fans&rdquo; (Mark Cuban), and he&rsquo;s not slowing down, having signed on as the announcer of the starry new wrestling venture All Elite Wrestling. In this follow-up to his bestselling memoir <i>Slobberknocker</i>, he dishes out about not only his long career, which includes nurturing global stars like Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, and John Cena, but also about his challenges of aging and disability, his split from collaborator Vince McMahon, and the sudden death of his beloved wife, Jan. The result is a gruff, endearing, and remarkably human-scale portrait, set against the larger than life backdrop of professional wrestling.<BR> <BR>Ross&rsquo;s ascent in WWE mirrors the rise of professional wrestling itself from a DIY sideshow to a billion-dollar business. <i>Under the Black Hat </i>traces all the highs and lows of that wild ride, in which Jim served not only as on-air commentator, but talent manager, payroll master, and even occasional in-ring foil to threats like Paul &ldquo;Triple H&rdquo; Levesque and Undertaker. While his role brought him riches and exposure he had never dreamed of, he chafed against the strictures of a fickle corporate culture and what he saw as a narrow vision of what makes great wrestlers&#8212;and great story lines. When suddenly stricken with Bell&rsquo;s palsy, a form of facial paralysis that makes it impossible to smile, he started down his greatest fear&#8212;being cast out of the announcing booth for good.<BR> <BR>Picking up where <i>Slobberknocker </i>left off and ending on the cusp of a new career in a reimagined industry, <i>Under the Black Hat</i> is the triumphant tale of a country boy who made it to the top, took a few knocks, and stuck around&#8212;just where his fans like him. Not only being one of the greatest wrestlers of the WWE, Ross is also &ldquo;a master storyteller, and this book is the perfect forum for his forty years&rsquo; worth of tales&rdquo; (Chris Jericho, former WWE champion).]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>A poignant coming-of-age memoir by the daughter of artistic, bohemian parents&#8212;set against a backdrop of 1950s New York, Cape Cod, and Mexico.</b><BR><BR>Hayden Herrera&rsquo;s parents each married five times; following their desires was more important to them than looking after their children. When Herrera was only three years old, her parents separated and she and her sister moved from Cape Cod to New York City to live with their mother and their new hard-drinking stepfather. They saw their father only during summers on the Cape, when they and the other neighborhood children would be left to their own devices by parents who were busy painting, writing, or composing music. These adults inhabited a world that Herrera&rsquo;s mother called &ldquo;upper bohemia,&rdquo; a milieu of people born to privilege who chose to focus on the life of the mind. Her parents&rsquo; friends included such literary and artistic heavyweights as artist Max Ernst, writers Edmund Wilson and Mary McCarthy, architect Marcel Breuer, and collector Peggy Guggenheim.<BR> <BR>On the surface, Herrera&rsquo;s childhood was idyllic and surreal. But underneath, the pain of being a parent&rsquo;s afterthought was acute. <i>Upper Bohemia</i> captures the tension between a child&rsquo;s excitement at every new thing and her sadness at losing the comfort of a reliable family. For her parents, both painters, the thing that mattered most was beauty&#8212;and so her childhood was expanded by art and by a reverence for nature. But her early years were also marred by abuse and by absent, irresponsible adults. Herrera would move from place to place, parent to parent, relative to family friend, and school to school&#8212;eventually following her mother to Mexico. The step-parents and step-siblings kept changing, too.<BR> <BR>Intimate and honest, <i>Upper Bohemia</i> is a celebration of a wild and pleasure-filled way of living&#8212;and a poignant reminder of the toll such narcissism takes on the children raised in its grip.]]></d104>

The suggested questions are intended to help your reading group find new and interesting angles and topics for your discussion. We hope that these ideas will enrich your conversation and increase your enjoyment of the book.</i><BR><BR><b>Introduction</b><BR><BR><b>The author of the &ldquo;rich, dark, and intricately twisted&rdquo; (Ruth Ware, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author) <i>The Family Upstairs </i>returns with another taut and white-knuckled thriller following a group of people whose lives shockingly intersect when a young woman disappears.</b><BR><BR>Owen Pick&rsquo;s life is falling apart.<BR><BR>In his thirties, a virgin, and living in his aunt&rsquo;s spare bedroom, he has just been suspended from his job as a computer science teacher after accusations of sexual misconduct, which he strongly denies. Searching for professional advice online, he is inadvertently sucked into the dark world of incel&#8212;involuntary celibate&#8212;forums, where he meets the charismatic, mysterious, and sinister Bryn.<BR><BR>Across the street from Owen lives the Fours family, headed by mom Cate, a physiotherapist, and dad Roan, a child psychologist. But the Fours family have a bad feeling about their neighbor Owen. He&rsquo;s a bit creepy, and their teenaged daughter swears he followed her home from the train station one night.<BR><BR>Meanwhile, young Saffyre Maddox spent three years as a patient of Roan Fours. Feeling abandoned when their therapy ends, she searches for other ways to maintain her connection with him, following him in the shadows and learning more than she wanted to know about Roan and his family. Then, on Valentine&rsquo;s night, Saffyre Maddox disappears&#8212;and the last person to see her alive is Owen Pick.<BR><BR>With evocative, vivid, and unputdownable prose and plenty of disturbing twists and turns, Jewell&rsquo;s latest thriller is another &ldquo;haunting, atmospheric, stay-up-way-too-late read&rdquo; (Megan Miranda, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author).<BR><BR><b>Topics & Questions for Discussion</b><BR><BR>1. <i>Invisible Girl</i> is told from three perspectives: Saffyre, Cate, and Owen. Was there one character in particular whose point of view you were intrigued by? How might you have felt about these characters had you not been provided with a first-person account of their lives? Why do you think Lisa Jewell structured her novel this way, and chose these people specifically to focus on?<BR><BR>2. We are first introduced to the character of Owen through the Fours&rsquo; daughter Georgia, who describes him as &ldquo;creepy&rdquo; (page 7), and later says he looks &ldquo;totally rapey&rdquo; (page 28), despite never having interacted with him. We only hear from Owen himself nearly sixty pages into the novel, at which point he has already been called &ldquo;creepy&rdquo; three times. What did you think of Owen after actually having met him? As the novel unfolded, what descriptive details about him did you feel fit the stereotypically &ldquo;creepy&rdquo; bill? Do you think that Georgia&rsquo;s first reaction was justified?<BR><BR>3. One theme of the book is the role that childhood trauma plays out in teenage and adult lives. In what ways have Saffyre&rsquo;s assault and Owen&rsquo;s abandonment influenced their current behavior and interpersonal relationships? How do they each confront and work through the lasting psychological effects over the course of the novel?<BR><BR>4. <i>Invisible Girl</i> takes place in a quiet, posh neighborhood occupied by mostly large, security-gated houses. One standout location is the empty plot of land where a house has been torn down and never rebuilt&#8212;what Cate calls a &ldquo;dark, private void&rdquo; (page 9). For Cate, it represents potential lurking danger and the unknown; for Saffyre, it represents freedom; for Josh, friendship. Compare and contrast these characters&rsquo; ideas of this in-between space and the neighborhood in general. Where do their feelings stem from? How might age, gender, and other life circumstances affect this? Why do you think the author chose this setting? How does it move the plot along?<BR><BR>5. <i>Invisible Girl </i>is filled with complicated familial and romantic relationships. When asked by Roan to describe what love feels like, Saffyre identifies two different kinds: one that involves need (&ldquo;It feels like need. . . . Like you love someone because they give you what you need&rdquo; (page 49), and one that does not, and is &ldquo;pure.&rdquo; Using this dichotomy, can you identify the different types of love that appear in this novel? Do both parties seem to be in agreement about the nature of their relationship?<BR><BR>6. Appearance&#8212;whether in the sense of physical attractiveness or more general presentation&#8212;is a big theme in <i>Invisible Girl</i>, but the way that it applies to men and women is different. Saffyre says, &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re pretty everyone just assumes you must have a great life&rdquo; (page 4). Owen obsessively categorizes women as good-looking or not and shapes his interactions accordingly, often paralyzed by &ldquo;extreme female beauty&rdquo; (page 107). Are there any instances of men being evaluated or interacted with in the same way? What is it that&rsquo;s so enticing or dangerous about the idea of a beautiful, carefree woman in the context of the novel?<BR><BR>7. While most people find sanctity in their own homes, Saffyre is very connected to the outdoors: &ldquo;I needed the air on my skin. I needed trees and soil and damp and moonlight and daylight and sun and wind and pigeons and foxes. It was like I was becoming feral&rdquo; (page 168). She later says, &ldquo;By night I was a kind of nocturnal animal, like the human equivalent of a fox&rdquo; (page 264). What does it mean to Saffyre to become feral, beyond sleeping outside? What is it that draws her to the fox, specifically?<BR><BR>8. Though the title of this novel refers to Saffyre, many different characters experience both invisibility and anonymity. For Saffyre, being invisible provides a respite from the eyes of her classmates, a kind of safety. Cate feels entirely unseen by Roan, free of having to reconstruct her marriage, but ignored. Owen feels forgotten. Bryn hides behind relative anonymity on incel platforms. Is there a difference between invisibility and anonymity? How might these states be viewed as positive or negative? How did each character&rsquo;s perspective on the idea of invisibility or anonymity help you understand them and their motivations?<BR><BR>9. Cate, as seen through Owen and Saffyre&rsquo;s eyes, is little more than a betrayed housewife. Owen wonders, &ldquo;What do women like this <i>think</i> about . . . when it&rsquo;s just them, and the kids are in bed, and they&rsquo;ve got one of those gigantic fishbowls of wine in their hands? What are they when they&rsquo;re not at the gym or collecting their children from school? Where do they exist on the scale of humanity? He cannot imagine&rdquo; (page 64). Saffyre, upon learning of Roan&rsquo;s cheating, has a similar train of thought: &ldquo;What happens to a woman like that with a pretend job and children just about to leave home? Where would Cate Fours end up?&rdquo; (page 124) Though one of these inquiries is more steeped in sexism, together they raise questions about Cate&rsquo;s autonomy. How does Cate ultimately end up taking control of her life and regaining what she calls the &ldquo;moral high ground&rdquo; in light of Roan&rsquo;s infidelity? Do you think she defies the well-worn stereotype? Do you think hers could be considered a heroine arc?<BR><BR>10. Though there are references to Roan slipping away and being unreachable for suspicious hours at the beginning of<i> Invisible Girl</i>, he is not more directly suggested to be involved in the assaults until later in the novel. What about Roan&rsquo;s character made these initial hints seem negligible? Were you surprised by the anger and condescension he displayed when Cate first asked him about Saffyre&rsquo;s time in his care? How would you compare his sudden outbursts and rage to Owen&rsquo;s? How does their disrespect for women manifest in each man&rsquo;s behavior? Why do you think Owen is featured more prominently, and is given a first-person voice, whereas Roan is not?<BR><BR>11. Cate treats her son and daughter differently when it comes to matters of safety and privacy; &ldquo;for some reason her son&rsquo;s privacy seems more sacred, more fragile than her daughter&rsquo;s&rdquo; (page 117). While she talks frankly about the potential that Georgia could be violated, she feels so removed from Josh&rsquo;s inner life that at one point she fears that he has been the neighborhood perpetrator all along. How do you think we should change the way we parent by gender, especially in adolescence? Are there conversations that should be had separately with teenagers of different genders, or should everyone be presented with the same information?<BR><BR>12. Do you think that <i>Invisible Girl </i>takes a firm stance on whom we as a society might owe a second chance at fair judgment? What do you think keeps Owen from being fully sucked into the incel community and becoming a Bryn-like figure, who concludes the book as a declared terrorist threat? By the novel&rsquo;s end, how did you feel about each of the characters we have watched flounder morally?<BR><BR><b>Enhance Your Book Club</b><BR><BR>1. One of the biggest news stories about incels in recent memory is Alice Hines&rsquo; feature in <i>The Cut</i>, &ldquo;How Many Bones Would You Break to Get Laid?&rdquo; [<a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/05/incel-plastic-surgery.html">https://www.thecut.com/2019/05/incel-plastic-surgery.html</a>] Read the article and discuss what you&rsquo;ve learned about the incel community. Do you feel that you understand Owen and Bryn more or less after having read this piece?<BR><BR> 2. One of Lisa Jewell&rsquo;s latest novels, <i>The Family Upstairs</i>, centers around a cult-like group of people living in one house. Compare and contrast the leader, David, with the characters of Bryn and Roan from <i>Invisible Girl</i>. What about their power and mystique is fabricated? What is real?<BR><BR>3. Consider donating to or volunteering with RAINN, the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network, the nation&rsquo;s largest anti&#8211;sexual violence organization.]]></d104>

In page after hilarious page, one brilliantly crafted observation after another, readers will witness the evolution of one of the great comedians of our time and gain new insights into the thrilling but unforgiving art of writing stand-up comedy.]]></d104>

For the first time, the audiobook is deemed &#39;A Novel,&#39;&nbsp;with no installment number in its subtitle. (It&#39;s #27.) But not much else has changed in the bounty hunter&#39;s world. Fans will find it comforting to revisit Stephanie, Lulu, Morelli, Ranger, Grandma Mazur, Connie, and Stephanie&#39;s mother, all masterfully performed by King, who creates a unique voice for each character. Yes, Stephanie explodes cars, and Lulu explodes out of her spandex clothes on their treasure-hunting mission. Evanovich also introduces a new character, Gabriela Rose, a fashion-conscious female Indiana Jones who will be featured in a brand-new series. King&#39;s pacing, accents, intonations, and ability to convincingly perform men and women, good guys and bad, keep the series entertaining.&quot;]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>Winner of the 2021 Audie Award</b><BR><BR><b>This practical and inspirational guide to healing from the award-winning, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Choice</i> shows us how to stop destructive patterns and imprisoning thoughts to find freedom and enjoy life.</b><BR><BR>Edith Eger&rsquo;s powerful first book <i>The Choice </i>told the story of her survival in the concentration camps, her escape, healing, and journey to freedom. Oprah Winfrey says, &ldquo;I will be forever changed by Dr. Eger&rsquo;s story.&rdquo; Thousands of people around the world have written to Eger to tell her how <i>The Choice </i>moved them and inspired them to confront their own past and try to heal their pain; and to ask her to write another, more &ldquo;how-to&rdquo; book. Now, in <i>The Gift</i>, Eger expands on her message of healing and provides a hands-on guide that gently encourages us to change the thoughts and behaviors that may be keeping us imprisoned in the past.<BR> <BR> Eger explains that the worst prison she experienced is not the prison that Nazis put her in but the one she created for herself, the prison within her own mind. She describes the twelve most pervasive imprisoning beliefs she has known&#8212;including fear, grief, anger, secrets, stress, guilt, shame, and avoidance&#8212;and the tools she has discovered to deal with these universal challenges. Accompanied by stories from Eger&rsquo;s own life and the lives of her patients each chapter includes thought-provoking questions and takeaways, such as:<BR> <BR>-Would you like to be married to you?<BR> -Are you evolving or revolving?<BR> -You can&rsquo;t heal what you can&rsquo;t feel.<BR> <BR> Filled with empathy, insight, and humor, <i>The Gift</i> captures the vulnerability and common challenges we all face and provides encouragement and advice for breaking out of our personal prisons to find healing and enjoy life.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[&quot;Tovah Feldshuh&#39;s mature voice and acclaimed acting skills make her an excellent choice to perform this heartfelt advice from a 93-year-old Jewish&ndash;Hungarian clinical psychologist and Holocaust survivor. Feldshuh&#39;s lilting phrasing is incredibly varied, beautiful to hear in itself, and finessed to match every nuance in the shifting themes of this work. Her performance really shines because of her audible connection with the author&#39;s empathy, compassion, and wisdom. Eger&#39;s story of surviving the death camps at Auschwitz and her focus on helping people recover from trauma could have made this audiobook difficult to hear. But with the warmth and sensibilities of the author and the narrator working together so effectively, what dominates the listening is hope and infectious confidence in the wisdom of Eger&#39;s empowering advice.&quot;]]></d104>

Discuss Besty&rsquo;s continued obsession with affluent families and life of luxury. Do you think she&rsquo;s satisfied when she&rsquo;s admitted to &ldquo;The Washington Country Club&rdquo; or will she always be a social climber? Why or why not?<BR><BR>2. Billy is the son of a general. They live in a home trimmed with Doric columns, and Billy speaks to his father with the respect one gives a general. He lives a life of affluence with a guaranteed admittance to West Point. Why does Billy get upset when Marty teases him about his last name being the reason for the opportunities he has? Is there an underlying feeling of guilt&#8212;why or why not?<BR><BR>3. Bunny takes Mackenzie Wallace under her wing despite Bunny&rsquo;s mother, Meredith, insisting the Wallace family are &ldquo;commoners.&rdquo; What do you think Bunny&rsquo;s intentions were in cultivating a friendship with Mackenzie?<BR><BR>4. Chapter 15 is a pivotal point for Bunny, Mackenzie, Billy, Marty, and Stan. How does their inherent privilege play into their grave mistake?<BR><BR>5. How does Cate assert her dominance over Senator Wallace in the crypt at the Banks family&rsquo;s funeral? How is this a pivotal moment for Cate&rsquo;s career?<BR><BR>6. Discuss Bunny&rsquo;s initial motives for visiting Anthony Tell in jail? How does Anthony&rsquo;s situation mirror the modern American justice system?<BR><BR>7. On the way to meet her mother for a Georgetown Christmas homes tour, Bunny finds out that her birthday check has bounced. As she tours the historic houses, Bunny&rsquo;s patience with high society dwindles. Discuss the causes that lead to Bunny&rsquo;s breakdown during the tour?<BR><BR>8. Are Senator Wallace&rsquo;s intentions pure when he reaches out to Lisa to apologize about his sexual misconduct? Why is his conscience constantly guilty when it comes to women and sex?<BR><BR>9. By the end of the book how have the teenagers changed? In your opinion, who has changed the most? Was it for better or worse?<BR><BR>10. Was it a shock when Senator Wallace&rsquo;s name didn&rsquo;t show up in the news story about sexual misconduct in politics? Why or why not?<BR><BR>11. What motives does Cate have to send the voice recording of Senator Wallace to the <i>Washington Post</i> reporter in the end? Why do you think she ultimately decided to hurt Senator Wallace?<BR><BR>12. We&rsquo;re never told who actually killed the Banks family. Who do you think committed the crime and why? Do you think the true killer will ever be uncovered?<BR><BR><b>Enhance Your Book Club</b><BR><BR>1. This book contains niche historical references between chapters, which explain pieces of history you may not have known. Have each member of your group pick their favorite historical reference and share why they feel it enhances the chapter.<BR><BR>2. Discuss different portrayals of Washington insiders and their children throughout other works of fiction or media. For example, <i>West Wing</i> or <i>House of Cards</i>. How does <i>The</i> <i>Cave Dwellers</i> (and its characters) fit in?<BR><BR>3. &ldquo;Cave Dweller&rdquo; is a term, indigenous to Washington, DC, that defines a member of those families who have resided there for generations and whose bloodlines are woven into the warp and weft of the nation&rsquo;s capital. Had you heard the term &ldquo;cave dweller&rdquo; before reading the book? Do you think this term accurately captures this group of people? And do you think there are families similar to the &ldquo;cave dwellers&rdquo; in Washington in other cities across America?]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>Using her personal experience living</b><b> as a professional woman with Autism Spectrum Disorder</b><b>, Sarah Nannery, together with her husband, Larry, offers this timely communication guide for anyone on the Autism spectrum looking to successfully navigate work, life, and love. </b><BR><BR>When Sarah Nannery got her first job at a small nonprofit, she thought she knew exactly what it would take to advance. But soon she realized that even with hard work and conscientiousness, she was missing key meanings and messages embedded in her colleagues&rsquo; everyday requests, feedback, and praise. She had long realized her brain operated differently than others, but now she knew for sure: she had Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).<BR> <BR>With help from her neurotypical partner&#8212;now husband&#8212;Larry, mostly in frantic IM chats, Sarah rose to Director of Development at one of the world&rsquo;s largest nonprofits. Together they have tackled challenges in how Sarah navigates personal and professional relationships, how they navigate marriage and parenthood, all of which are differently challenging for someone with ASD. But she wonders, at times, how life would be different if she&rsquo;d had to figure it all out herself. So, in <i>What to Say Next</i>, she offers advice, empathy, and straightforward strategies from her own tool-kit&#8212;not only for others who see the world differently, but for their families, partners and colleagues.<BR> <BR>In <i>What to Say Next</i>, Sarah breaks down everyday situations&#8212;the chat in the break room, the last-minute meeting, the unexpected run-in&#8212;in granular detail, explaining not only how to understand the goals of others, but also how to frame your own. Larry adds his thoughts from a neurotypical perspective, sharing what was going on in his brain and how he learned to listen and enlighten, while supporting and maintaining Sarah&rsquo;s voice. At a time when more and more people are being diagnosed with ASD&#8212;especially women and girls&#8212;this book tells important truths about what it takes to make it in a neurotypical world, and still be true to yourself.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>From a writer celebrated for her &ldquo;chops, ambition, and killer instinct&rdquo; (John Powers, <i>Fresh Air</i>), a career-spanning collection of spectacular essays about politics and culture.</b><BR><BR>Rachel Kushner has established herself as &ldquo;the most vital and interesting American novelist working today&rdquo; (Michael Lindgren, <i>The Millions</i>) and as a master of the essay form. In <i>The Hard Crowd</i>, she gathers a selection of her writing from over the course of the last twenty years that addresses the most pressing political, artistic, and cultural issues of our times&#8212;and illuminates the themes and real-life terrain that underpin her fiction.<BR> <BR>In nineteen razor-sharp essays, <i>The Hard Crowd </i>spans literary journalism, memoir, cultural criticism, and writing about art and literature, including pieces on Jeff Koons, Denis Johnson, and Marguerite Duras. Kushner takes us on a journey through a Palestinian refugee camp, an illegal motorcycle race down the Baja Peninsula, 1970s wildcat strikes in Fiat factories, her love of classic cars, and her young life in the music scene of her hometown, San Francisco. The closing, eponymous essay is her manifesto on nostalgia, doom, and writing.<BR> <BR>These pieces, new and old, are electric, phosphorescently vivid, and wry, and they provide an opportunity to witness the evolution and range of one of our most dazzling and fearless writers. &ldquo;Kushner writes with startling detail, imagination, and gallows humor,&rdquo; said Leah Greenblatt in <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, and, from Paula McLain in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>: &ldquo;The authority and precision of Kushner&rsquo;s writing is impressive, but it&rsquo;s the gorgeous ferocity that will stick with me.&rdquo;<BR> <BR><b>&ldquo;[Kushner] seems to work with a muse and a nail gun, so surprisingly yet forcefully do her sentences pin reality to the page.&rdquo; &#8212;Kathryn Schulz, <i>New York m</i>agazine</b><BR> <BR><b>&ldquo;Kushner can really write. Her prose has a poise and wariness and moral graininess that puts you in mind of Robert Stone and Joan Didion.&rdquo; &#8212;Dwight Garner, <i>The New York Times</i></b>]]></d104>

During the summers, while her mother worked days in a local motel and danced most nights in the Provincetown bars, her babysitter&#8212;the kind, handsome handyman at the motel where her mother worked&#8212;took her and her sister on adventures in his truck. He bought them popsicles and together, they visited his &ldquo;secret garden&rdquo; in the Truro woods. To Liza, he was one of the few kind and understanding adults in her life. Everyone thought he was just a &ldquo;great guy.&rdquo;<BR> <BR>But there was one thing she didn&rsquo;t know; their babysitter was a serial killer.<BR> <BR>Some of his victims were buried&#8212;in pieces&#8212;right there, in his garden in the woods. Though Tony Costa&rsquo;s gruesome case made screaming headlines in 1969 and beyond, Liza never made the connection between her friendly babysitter and the infamous killer of numerous women, including four in Massachusetts, until decades later.<BR> <BR>Haunted by nightmares and horrified by what she learned, Liza became obsessed with the case. Now, she and cowriter Jennifer Jordan reveal the chilling and unforgettable true story of a charming but brutal psychopath through the eyes of a young girl who once called him her friend.]]></d104>

But then she miscarried&#8212;once, twice, three times. Determined to expand their family, the Durbins turn to adoption. When several adoptions fall through, Gail&rsquo;s desire for a child overwhelms her.<BR> <BR> Carli is a pregnant teenager from a blue-collar town nearby, with dreams of going to college and getting out of her mother&rsquo;s home. When she makes the gut-wrenching decision to give her baby up for adoption, she chooses the Durbins. But Carli&rsquo;s mother, Marla, has other plans for her grandbaby.<BR> <BR> In <i>Other People&rsquo;s Children</i>, three mothers make excruciating choices to protect their families and their dreams&#8212;choices that put them at decided odds against one another. You will root for each one of them and wonder just how far you&rsquo;d go in the same situation. This riveting debut is a thoughtful exploration of love and family, and a heart-pounding page-turner you&rsquo;ll find impossible to put down.<BR><BR><b>Topics & Questions for Discussion </b><BR><BR>1. From the start, we learn about Gail and Jon&rsquo;s struggle to have a baby. After suffering three miscarriages, Gail and Jon turn to adoption, a process with its own unique stresses. What are their respective coping mechanisms to deal with the uncertainty?<BR><BR>2. Through flashbacks, we learn about Jon&rsquo;s troubled childhood. His mother was depressed and neglectful. How do these memories inform his concerns about fatherhood?<BR><BR>3. When Carli first considers reclaiming her baby, Paige repeats to herself, &ldquo;<i>Right down the middle. Don&rsquo;t take sides. Right down the middle</i>&rdquo; (p. 145). Does Paige stay neutral? How does she help Carli, Gail, and Jon make their decisions?<BR><BR>4. Carli studies psychology at school. At one point, she slogs through Carol Gilligan&rsquo;s ethics of care, which state that &ldquo;At the first level, girls make important decisions based upon what&rsquo;s best for them. . . . At the second level, women make their decisions based upon what&rsquo;s best for others.&rdquo; Then she reads: &ldquo;Lots of women never make it to the third level . . . where women <i>balance their moral choices between their own needs and care for others. Do no harm to yourself and do no harm to others</i>&rdquo; (p. 140). What level describes Carli&rsquo;s development at different points in the novel?<BR><BR>5. Gail and Jon&rsquo;s decision to flee with Maya is spontaneous. Gail asks, &ldquo;&lsquo;What if we take her?&rsquo;&rdquo; (p. 177) and Jon agrees. What propels them to make this radical decision? How do you feel about their decision, and how do you think you would react if presented with their situation?<BR><BR>6. How does R.J. Hoffmann make you sympathize with all the characters and their decisions, even though the situation pits them against one another?<BR><BR>7. Gail and Jon&rsquo;s marriage struggles under the expectations and disappointments involved in their desire to have a baby. How does touch meaningfully play into their marriage?<BR><BR>8. While sharpening knives, Gail thinks about her father&rsquo;s advice to &ldquo;Feel the balance of it&rdquo; (p. 243). What does he mean by this? How does this advice influence Gail while she&rsquo;s on the run with Jon and Maya?<BR><BR>9. Marla pressures Carli to reclaim the baby because Marla wants the chance to become a good grandmother and compensate for how she raised her daughters, Carli and Wendy. On the other hand, Paige suspects that if Carli reclaims the baby, &ldquo;Marla would watch Maya once, maybe twice. . . . She would make excuses, make herself scarce, and Carli would realize how alone she really was&rdquo; (p. 144). Do you think Paige is right? Would Marla make a good grandmother, or would she be absent again? What is &ldquo;good&rdquo; parenting and grandparenting?<BR><BR>10. Marla is an abusive mother. When experiencing anger, she &ldquo;felt nothing but the heat, her vision went black around the edges, and her fists hardened&rdquo; (p. 273). Why does Marla lash out at the people she loves? What does her anger say about her? How much of her anger is due to her circumstances and how much of it is her personality?<BR><BR>11. How does R.J. Hoffmann develop the novel from a family drama into a thriller? How did your reading experience change as you progressed through the story?<BR><BR>12. According to Paige, Marla and Carli live in a neighborhood where &ldquo;All the houses on Carli&rsquo;s block looked depressingly the same&rdquo; (p. 123). Gail and Jon are middle class with access to more resources and money. How do socioeconomic issues manifest in the characters&rsquo; dynamics? How does it manifest in the conflict over Maya?<BR><BR>13. Carli is surprised to learn about Paige&rsquo;s teenage pregnancy and decision to keep her daughter against her mother&rsquo;s wishes. Paige says she works for the adoption agency &ldquo;So that girls like us have a choice&rdquo; (p. 339). Did Paige&rsquo;s backstory surprise you?<BR><BR>14. How do you feel about the novel&rsquo;s ending? Did all the characters get what they wanted or deserved?<BR><BR>15. After finishing the book, reexamine the title. In what ways can it be interpreted?<BR><BR><b>Enhance Your Book Club </b><BR><BR>1. With its emotional twists and riveting getaway, <i>Other People&rsquo;s Children </i>has cinematic qualities that lend themselves to film. Who would you cast as its stars?<BR><BR>2. Gail and Jon deal with the intricacies and stresses of the adoption process. Does anyone in your group have personal experience with adoption? Do some research and discuss your findings: What is the process of domestic adoption? What kind of requirements are involved and what is the time line?<BR><BR>3. The book takes place in Elmhurst and Morris, Illinois. Plan a trip with your book club to explore the cities!<BR><BR>4. Supplement your fictional experience and learn about the real history of adoption in America. Check out books such as <i>American Baby</i> by Gabrielle Glaser, or watch the documentary <i>Three Identical Strangers</i> (dir. Tim Wardle).<BR><BR><b>A Conversation with R.J. Hoffmann </b><BR><BR><b>Q: Congratulations on your debut novel, <i>Other People&rsquo;s Children</i>! Can you share your journey as a writer? Did you always want to be an author?</b><BR><BR>A: I blame all of this on my parents. When I was seven, my family&rsquo;s television broke, and they decided not to replace it until my siblings and I all made the honor roll in the same quarter. It took us a few years to piece that together, and in the meantime I became addicted to reading. When I was growing up, becoming a writer was like becoming an astronaut or a professional soccer player&#8212;something to fantasize about but not practical enough for serious consideration. So, instead, I became an IT consultant and wrote in the margins of my life. The fantasy persisted, though, and it&rsquo;s fair to say that it&rsquo;s always been something I dreamed of.<BR><BR>As I approached fifty, I realized that &ldquo;always&rdquo; has an expiration date, so I decided to quit my job and go back to school for my MFA. I kept quiet about it because it felt a bit foolish. I only told those closest to me, and those who asked how work was going. I probably gave more effort to each semester at Columbia than to my entire undergrad. I approached it as a job and spent fifty hours each week on schoolwork and writing. I was old enough to recognize the value of the opportunity I was given. <BR><BR><b>Q: What was your inspiration for this story? Do you have personal experience with adoption that influenced the novel? How much research did you need to do while writing? </b><BR><BR>A: My wife and I adopted both of our children (internationally). That experience taught me what it means to wait, how to sit with the uncertainty that is essential to the adoption process. I also felt that immediate attachment that Jon and Gail felt for Maya. There was nothing gradual about the way that we fell in love with our children. Gail described it as &ldquo;like waking from a dream into a bright light.&rdquo;<BR><BR>For me, the book really centers on the expectations with which we all enter adulthood and the way that life sometimes shreds them. My daughter struggles with a variety of challenges, and a year before I began my writing program, those challenges became so volatile that we were forced to send her to a residential treatment center. By the beginning of the pandemic, thankfully, she was ready to come home. Everything about that experience tore me apart. The pain of being separated from my daughter&#8212;and adjusting my expectations to that reality&#8212;inspired the book and may explain some of the heavy emotions that the story churns up.<BR><BR>For better or worse, I tend to avoid up-front research. I research after I write, to learn whether I&rsquo;ve imagined a place or an experience in a way that aligns with reality and to make sure that I&rsquo;ve gotten important facts right. For me, research can be an excuse to put off the writing, and although it can enrich the details, it can also confine the imagination with pesky facts. So I get the characters and the story down first, and then later I go find out whether I&rsquo;ve invented something that departs too far from reality. <BR><BR><b>Q: This novel is memorable for its depiction of motherhood. Gail, Carli, and Marla are mothers with intense desires and a deep capacity for love. At the same time, they demonstrate this love in very different ways. What prompted you to focus on motherhood? </b><BR><BR>A: I would suggest that the story focuses on parenthood. The story began as Jon and Gail&rsquo;s, but when I wrote that first scene from Carli&rsquo;s point of view&#8212;when her water breaks in the classroom&#8212;something shifted for me. I found her deeply interesting. Over time, as Carli&rsquo;s character burst onto the pages, she demanded a starring role, and the story re-centered itself upon Carli and Gail, elbowing Jon into a supporting role. I&rsquo;ve never been a mother, but parenthood is central to my identity. I sometimes wonder if motherhood and fatherhood <i>feel</i> similar, even if men and women express those emotions very differently. <BR><BR><b>Q: Early in the novel, Paige remarks that the Durbins don&rsquo;t seem to really &ldquo;fit.&rdquo; What was the inspiration for Jon and Gail&rsquo;s characters? Do you think they&rsquo;re well suited for each other? How did they and their relationship with each other develop during the writing process? </b><BR><BR>A: I think that, in so many ways, Gail and Jon are complementary. Gail organizes their lives while Jon brings the ability to improvise and adjust. Throughout the story, the strengths of one complement the weaknesses of the other.<BR><BR>A funny thing happened between Jon and Gail&rsquo;s characters as I wrote the book. I gave a version to an early reader and was told that Jon&rsquo;s character was strong, but Gail didn&rsquo;t come through clearly. I rewrote Gail&rsquo;s chapters, didn&rsquo;t touch Jon&rsquo;s, and gave the book to another reader. The feedback: Gail was fantastic, but Jon felt weak. This happened over and over. The strengthening of one character washed out the other. I think the competition between those two characters inevitably strengthened the book. They demanded more and better of each other. I&rsquo;m not sure that I could invent a better metaphor for marriage than that. <BR><BR><b>Q: <i>Other People&rsquo;s Children </i>explores the class differences between Marla, Carli, Gail, and Jon through the different cities in which they live. Marla and Carli live in Morris, whereas Gail and Jon live in Elmhurst. What did you want readers to take away about class divisions in America? </b><BR><BR>A: I want readers to take away the idea that integrity lives on both sides of the tracks. As do dishonesty and work ethic and malevolence and disappointment.<BR><BR><b>Q: Carli thinks about fundamental attribution errors, &ldquo;the idea that people blame mistakes on your character rather than your circumstances&rdquo; (p. 95). The people in her life think she is a &ldquo;fuckup&rdquo; because of her pregnancy. By the end of the book, what do you hope readers will take away from Carli&rsquo;s self-perception? </b><BR><BR>A: When Carli studies that chapter, she finds herself at the nadir of her self-regard. She goes through a lot in her fight to reclaim her baby, and once Maya comes home to her, she still has much more to fight through. By the end of the book, she&rsquo;s struggling, but she&rsquo;s struggling with dignity and with a developing confidence. I&rsquo;d like to believe that when Carli retakes that psychology class next semester, she&rsquo;ll digest that chapter differently. I want to believe that as she gains distance from the home she grew up in, and as she finds some success as a parent, that she&rsquo;ll begin to recognize the strength of her character. I hope that she&rsquo;ll discover a bit more compassion for herself. <BR><BR><b>Q: While writing the book, did you always know what the ending would be? </b><BR><BR>A: Absolutely not. I was a hundred pages in before I learned that Gail and Jon were going to run with Maya. I was struggling with what would happen next when a professor suggested to the class that we should consider having our characters do something illegal&#8212;and there it was. Once they broke toward Canada, I knew where Maya would land, but that same professor challenged me to keep the reader torn&#8212;until the last possible moment&#8212;about what <i>they</i> want for Maya. That suggestion served as a compass for the rest of the book, and it reminded me that Carli, Gail, and Jon are all victims, even as none of them are blameless.<BR><BR><b>Q: Marla is an extremely complex character. She&rsquo;s abusive to Carli and Wendy at times and experiences flashes of uncontrollable anger, yet she works hard to provide for her family and wants to be a good grandmother. What emotions did you hope Marla would evoke in readers?</b><BR><BR>A: I want people to feel strongly about Marla. When a friend reads the book, I sometimes get a text when they&rsquo;re halfway through it, and Marla&rsquo;s name usually shows up in that text. I don&rsquo;t expect anyone to side with her. She makes everyone&rsquo;s life difficult. But I hope that the strength of the reaction comes in part from the motivations (relatively pure) that drive Marla&rsquo;s actions (mostly destructive). Above all, I hope that readers examine their reaction for fundamental attribution errors.<BR><BR><b>Q: Which authors do you admire? </b><BR><BR>A: Toni Morrison is a marvel. I&rsquo;ve read most of the dozen or so books that Ian McEwan has given us. Cormac McCarthy&rsquo;s <i>The Road</i> took my breath away. I loved both of Celeste Ng&rsquo;s books and enjoyed my time in Mississippi with Jesmyn Ward. Fredrik Backman&rsquo;s novels are never the same and always wonderful. I love a sad ending, and Lauren Groff almost always delivers. John Steinbeck earned his way onto everyone&rsquo;s bookshelf. I try to read <i>The Pearl</i> every few years. <BR><BR><b>Q: Are you working on anything right now? If so, can you tell us about it? </b><BR><BR>A: I&rsquo;m finishing my second novel. It&rsquo;s about a terrible secret that four boys keep as they graduate high school, the corrosive nature of the lies that secret forces them to tell over the next thirty years, and what they must do to repair the damage.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[Joanne Harris is an Anglo-French author, whose books include fourteen novels, two cookbooks, and many short stories. Her work is extremely diverse, covering aspects of magical realism, suspense, historical fiction, mythology, and fantasy.&nbsp;In 2000, her 1999 novel <i>Chocolat </i>was adapted to the screen, starring Juliette Binoche and Johnny Depp. She is an honorary Fellow of St. Catharine&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, and in 2013 was awarded an MBE by the Queen. Her hobbies are listed in <i>Who&rsquo;s Who</i> as &ldquo;mooching, lounging, strutting, strumming, priest-baiting, and quiet subversion.&rdquo; She also spends too much time on Twitter, plays flute and bass guitar in a band first formed when she was sixteen, and works from a shed in her garden at her home in Yorkshire.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>United Nations Champion of the Earth, climate scientist, and evangelical Christian Katharine Hayhoe changes the debate on how we can save our future.</b><BR><BR>Called &ldquo;one of the nation's most effective communicators on climate change&rdquo; by <i>The New York Times</i>, Katharine Hayhoe knows how to navigate all sides of the conversation on our changing planet. A Canadian climate scientist living in Texas, she negotiates distrust of data, indifference to imminent threats, and resistance to proposed solutions with ease. Over the past fifteen years Hayhoe has found that the most important thing we can do to address climate change is talk about it&#8212;and she wants to teach you how.<BR> <BR> In <i>Saving Us,</i> Hayhoe argues that when it comes to changing hearts and minds, facts are only one part of the equation. We need to find shared values in order to connect our unique identities to collective action. This is not another doomsday narrative about a planet on fire. It is a multilayered look at science, faith, and human psychology, from an icon in her field&#8212;recently named chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy.<BR> <BR> Drawing on interdisciplinary research and personal stories, Hayhoe shows that small conversations can have astonishing results. <i>Saving Us</i> leaves us with the tools to open a dialogue with your loved ones about how we all can play a role in pushing forward for change.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>A vivid and incisive account of a mostly unknown yet critical chapter in the life of Eleanor Roosevelt&#8212;when she moved to New York&rsquo;s Greenwich Village, shed her high-born conformity, and became the progressive leader who pushed for change as America&rsquo;s First Lady.</b><BR><BR>Hundreds of books have been written about FDR and Eleanor, both together and separately, but yet she remains a compelling and elusive figure. And, not much is known about why in 1920, Eleanor suddenly abandoned her duties as a mother of five and moved to Greenwich Village, then the symbol of all forms of transgressive freedom&#8212;communism, homosexuality, interracial relationships, and subversive political activity. Now, in this fascinating, in-depth portrait, Jan Russell pulls back the curtain on Eleanor&rsquo;s life to reveal the motivations and desires that drew her to the Village and how her time there changed her political outlook.<BR> <BR>A captivating blend of personal history detailing Eleanor&rsquo;s struggle with issues of marriage, motherhood, financial independence, and femininity, and a vibrant portrait of one of the most famous neighborhoods in the world, this unique work examines the ways that the sensibility, mood, and various inhabitants of the neighborhood influenced the First Lady&rsquo;s perception of herself and shaped her political views over four decades, up to her death in 1962.<BR> <BR>When Eleanor moved there, the Village was a neighborhood of rogues and outcasts, a zone of Bohemians, misfits, and artists. But there was also freedom there, a miniature society where personal idiosyncrasy could flourish. Eleanor joined the cohort of what then was called &ldquo;The New Women&rdquo; in Greenwich Village. Unlike the flappers in the 1920s, the New Women had a much more serious agenda, organizing for social change&#8212;unions for workers, equal pay, protection for child workers&#8212;and they insisted on their own sexual freedom. These women often disagreed about politics&#8212;some, like Eleanor, were Democrats, others Republicans, Socialists, and Communists. Even after moving into the White House, Eleanor retained connections to the Village, ultimately purchasing an apartment in Washington Square where she lived during World War II and in the aftermath of Roosevelt&rsquo;s death in 1945.<BR> <BR>Including the major historical moments that served as a backdrop for Eleanor&rsquo;s time in the Village, this remarkable work offers new insights into Eleanor&rsquo;s transformation&#8212;emotionally, politically, and sexually&#8212;and provides us with the missing chapter in an extraordinary life.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>A fascinating look at the treatment of depression, blending journalism, science, history, and memoir, by an award-winning science writer.</b><BR><BR>What is depression? Is it a persistent low mood or a complex range of symptoms? Is it a single diagnosis or a diversity of mental disorders requiring different treatments? In <i>A Cure for Darkness</i>, science writer Alex Riley explores these questions, digging into the long history of depression and chronicling the lives of psychiatrists and scientists who sought cures for their patients.<BR> <BR>Since 2015, Riley has received both cognitive behavioral therapy and antidepressants for his own depression. Throughout his treatment, he wondered&#8212;are antidepressants effective? Do short-term talking therapies actually work? And what treatments are on the horizon for those who don&rsquo;t respond to these first-line treatments? Expanding from his own experience, he tracks treatments through history, from the &ldquo;talking cure&rdquo; to electroconvulsive therapy to magic mushrooms. With depression fast becoming the leading burden of disease around the world, the future of mental healthcare depends not just on the development of new therapies, but on increasing access for people who are currently without. Reporting on the field of global mental health from its colonial past to the present day, Riley highlights a range of scalable therapies, including how a group of grandmothers stands on the frontline of a mental health revolution.<BR> <BR>Weaving in personal and family history, <i>A Cure for Darkness </i>is a gripping narrative journey and a surprisingly hopeful work that delves deep into the science of mental health.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>NATIONAL BESTSELLER&#8203;</b><BR> <BR><b>A unique, unfiltered memoir from the NBA champion and fifteen-time all-star ahead of his induction into the Hall of Fame.</b><BR><BR>Kevin Garnett was one of the most dominant players the game of basketball has ever seen. He was also one of its most outspoken. Over the course of his illustrious twenty-one-year NBA career, he elevated trash talk to an art form and never shied away from sharing his thoughts on controversial subjects. In <i>KG A to Z</i>, published ahead of Garnett&rsquo;s induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame, he looks back on his life and career with the same raw candor.<BR> <BR>Garnett describes the adversity he faced growing up in South Carolina before ultimately relocating to Chicago, where he became one of the top prospects in the nation. He details his headline-making decision to skip college and become the first player in two decades to enter the draft directly from high school, starting a trend that would be followed by future superstars like Kobe Bryant and LeBron James. He shares stories of playing with and against Bryant, James, Michael Jordan, and other NBA greats, and he chronicles his professional ups and downs, including winning a championship with the Boston Celtics. He also speaks his mind on a range of topics beyond basketball, such as fame, family, racism, spirituality, and music.<BR> <BR>Garnett&rsquo;s draft decision wasn&rsquo;t the only way he&rsquo;d forever change the game. His ability to play on the perimeter as a big man foreshadowed the winning strategy now universally adopted by the league. He applies this same innovative spirit here, organizing the contents alphabetically as an encyclopedia. If you thought Kevin Garnett was exciting, inspiring, and unfiltered on the court, just wait until you read what he has to say in these pages.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>A powerful exploration of Black achievement in a white world based on honest, provocative, and moving interviews with Black leaders, scientists, artists, activists, and champions. </b><BR><BR><i>&ldquo;I remember the day I realized I couldn&rsquo;t play a white guy as well as a white guy. It felt like a death sentence for my career.&rdquo;</i><BR> <BR>When Chad Sanders landed his first job in lily white Silicon Valley, he quickly concluded that to be successful at work meant playing a certain social game. Each meeting was drenched in white slang and the privileged talk of international travel or folk concerts in San Francisco, which led Chad to believe he needed to emulate whiteness to be successful. So Chad changed. He changed his wardrobe, his behavior, his speech&#8212;everything that connected him with his Black identity. <BR> <BR>And while he finally felt included, he felt awful. So he decided to give up the charade. He reverted back to the methods he learned at the dinner table, or at the Black Baptist church where he&rsquo;d been raised, or at the concrete basketball courts, barbershops, and summertime cookouts. And it paid off. Chad began to land more exciting projects. He earned the respect of his colleagues. Accounting for this turnaround, Chad believes, was something he calls Black Magic, namely resilience, creativity, and confidence forged in his experience navigating America as a Black man. Black Magic has emboldened his every step since, leading him to wonder: Was he alone in this discovery? Were there others who felt the same?<BR> <BR>In moving essays, Chad dives into his formative experiences to see if they might offer the possibility of discovering or honing this skill. He tests his theory by interviewing Black leaders across industries to get their take on Black Magic. The result is a revelatory and very necessary book. <i>Black Magic</i> explores Black experiences in predominantly white environments and demonstrates the risks of self-betrayal and the value of being yourself.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>&ldquo;A luscious, layered story of inheritance, heartbreak, reinvention, and family. I adored this book.&rdquo; </b><b>&#8212;Kristan Higgins, </b><b><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author</b><BR> <BR><b>When a deed to an apartment in Paris turns up in an old attic trunk, an estranged mother and daughter must reunite to uncover the secret life of a family matriarch&#8212;perfect for fans of <i>The Little Paris Bookshop</i> and <i>The Beekeeper&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.</b><BR><BR>Hannah Bond has always been a bookworm, which is why she fled Florida&#8212;and her unstable, alcoholic mother&#8212;for a quiet life leading Jane Austen-themed tours through the British countryside. But on New Year&rsquo;s Eve, everything comes crashing down when she arrives back at her London flat to find her mother, Marla, waiting for her.<BR> <BR>Marla&rsquo;s brought two things with her: a black eye from her ex-boyfriend and an envelope. Its contents? The deed to an apartment in Paris, an old key, and newspaper clippings about the death of a famous writer named Andres Armand. Hannah, wary of her mother&rsquo;s motives, reluctantly agrees to accompany her to Paris, where against all odds, they discover great-grandma Ivy&rsquo;s apartment frozen in 1940 and covered in dust.<BR> <BR>Inside the apartment, Hannah and Marla discover mysterious clues about Ivy&rsquo;s life&#8212;including a diary detailing evenings of drinking and dancing with Hemingway, the Fitzgeralds, and other iconic expats. Outside, they retrace her steps through the city in an attempt to understand why she went to such great lengths to hide her Paris identity from future generations.<BR> <BR>A heartwarming and charming saga set in the City of Lights, <i>Lost in Paris </i>is an unforgettable celebration of family and the love between a mother and a daughter.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>An all-new novel based upon the explosive <i>Star Trek </i>TV series! </b><BR><BR>In a desperate attempt to prevent the artificial intelligence known as Control from seizing crucial information that could destroy all sentient life, Commander Michael Burnham donned the &ldquo;Red Angel&rdquo; time-travel suit and guided the USS <i>Discovery</i> into the future and out of harm&rsquo;s way. But something has gone terribly wrong, and Burnham has somehow arrived in a place far different from anything she could have imagined&#8212;more than nine hundred years out of her time, with <i>Discovery</i> nowhere to be found, and where the mysterious and cataclysmic event known as &ldquo;the Burn&rdquo; has utterly decimated Starfleet and, with it, the United Federation of Planets. How then can she possibly exist day-to-day in this strange place? What worlds are out there waiting to be discovered? Do any remnants of Starfleet and the Federation possibly endure? With more questions than answers, Burnham must nevertheless forge new friendships and new alliances if she hopes to survive this future long enough for the <i>Discovery</i> crew to find her....<BR> <BR>&trade;, &#174;, & &#169; 2021 CBS Studios, Inc.

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>From the #1 </b><i><b>New York Times</b></i><b> bestselling author of </b><i><b>Big Summer</b></i><b> comes another timely and deliciously twisty novel of intrigue, secrets, and the transformative power of female friendship.</b><BR><BR>Daisy Shoemaker can&rsquo;t sleep. With a thriving cooking business, full schedule of volunteer work, and a beautiful home in the Philadelphia suburbs, she should be content. But her teenage daughter can be a handful, her husband can be distant, her work can feel trivial, and she has lots of acquaintances, but no real friends. Still, Daisy knows she&rsquo;s got it good. So why is she up all night?<BR> <BR>While Daisy tries to identify the root of her dissatisfaction, she&rsquo;s also receiving misdirected emails meant for a woman named Diana Starling, whose email address is just one punctuation mark away from her own. While Daisy&rsquo;s driving carpools, Diana is chairing meetings. While Daisy&rsquo;s making dinner, Diana&rsquo;s making plans to reorganize corporations. Diana&rsquo;s glamorous, sophisticated, single-lady life is miles away from Daisy&rsquo;s simpler existence. When an apology leads to an invitation, the two women meet and become friends. But, as they get closer, we learn that their connection was not completely accidental. Who IS this other woman, and what does she want with Daisy?<BR> <BR>From the manicured Main Line of Philadelphia to the wild landscape of the Outer Cape, written with Jennifer Weiner&rsquo;s signature wit and sharp observations, <i>That Summer</i> is a story about surviving our pasts, confronting our futures, and the sustaining bonds of friendship.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>The </b><b><i>New York Times </i>bestselling Beach House series returns with this tender and compassionate novel following the Rutledge family as they face a summer of upheaval and change with perseverance, unity, and a dose of humor, discovering unexpected joys and lessons that will endure long past the season. </b><BR><BR>The coming of Spring usually means renewal, but for Linnea Rutledge, Spring 2020 threatens stagnation. Linnea faces another layoff, this time from the aquarium she adores. For her&#8212;and her family&#8212;finances, emotions, and health teeter at the brink. To complicate matters, her new love interest, Gordon, struggles to return to the Isle of Palms from England. Meanwhile, her old flame, John, turns up from California and is quarantining next door. She tries to ignore him, but when he sends her plaintive notes in the form of paper airplanes, old sparks ignite. When Gordon at last reaches the island, Linnea wonders&#8212;is it possible to love two men at the same time?<BR> <BR>Love in the time of the coronavirus proves challenging, at times humorous, and ever changing. Relationships are redefined, friendships made and broken, and marriages tested. As the weeks turn to months, and another sea turtle season comes to a close, Linnea learns there are more meaningful lessons learned during this summer than opportunities lost, that summer is a time of wonder, and that the exotic lives in our own back yards. In <i>The Summer of Lost and Found</i>, Linnea and the Rutledge family continue to face their challenges with the strength, faith, and commitment that has inspired fans for decades.<BR> <BR>Mary Alice Monroe once again delves into the complexities of family relationships and brings her signature &ldquo;sensitive and true&rdquo; (Dorothea Benton Frank, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author) storytelling to this poignant and timely novel of love, courage, and resilience.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>In this heart-pounding and sharply written thriller from J.A. Jance, the &ldquo;grand master of the genre&rdquo; (<i>The Providence Journal</i>), Ali Reynolds&rsquo;s personal life is thrown into turmoil just as two men show up on the scene&#8212;a former employee of her husband&rsquo;s who has just been released from prison and a serial killer who sets his sights a little too close to home. </b><BR><BR>Mateo Vega, a one-time employee of Ali Reynold&rsquo;s husband, B. Simpson, has spent the last sixteen years of his life behind bars. According to the courts, he murdered his girlfriend. But Mateo knows that her real killer is still on the loose, and the first thing he&rsquo;s going to do when he gets a taste of freedom is track him down. <BR> <BR>After being granted parole, a wary Mateo approaches Stu Ramey of High Noon Enterprises for a reference letter for a job application, but to his surprise, Stu gives him one better: He asks him to come on board and work for B. once again. Just as Mateo starts his new job, though, chaos breaks out at High Noon&#8212;a deadbeat tenant who is in arrears has just fled, and tech expert Cami Lee has gone missing. <BR> <BR>As Ali races to both find a connection between the two disappearances and help Mateo clear his name with the help of PI J.P. Beaumont, tragedy strikes in her personal life, and with lives hanging in the balance, she must thread the needle between good and evil before it&rsquo;s too late.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>A profound rumination on the concept of freedom from the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Tribe.</i></b><BR><BR>Throughout history, humans have been driven by the quest for two cherished ideals: community and freedom. The two don&rsquo;t coexist easily. We value individuality and self-reliance, yet are utterly dependent on community for our most basic needs. In this intricately crafted and thought-provoking book, Sebastian Junger examines the tension that lies at the heart of what it means to be human.<BR> <BR>For much of a year, Junger and three friends&#8212;a conflict photographer and two Afghan War vets&#8212;walked the railroad lines of the East Coast. It was an experiment in personal autonomy, but also in interdependence. Dodging railroad cops, sleeping under bridges, cooking over fires, and drinking from creeks and rivers, the four men forged a unique reliance on one another.<BR> <BR>In <i>Freedom</i>, Junger weaves his account of this journey together with primatology and boxing strategy, the history of labor strikes and Apache raiders, the role of women in resistance movements, and the brutal reality of life on the Pennsylvania frontier. Written in exquisite, razor-sharp prose, the result is a powerful examination of the primary desire that defines us.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>A lively, immersive history by an award-winning urbanist of New York City&rsquo;s transformation, and the lessons it offers for the city&rsquo;s future.</b><BR><BR>Dangerous, filthy, and falling apart, garbage piled on its streets and entire neighborhoods reduced to rubble; New York&rsquo;s terrifying, if liberating, state of nature in 1978 also made it the capital of American culture. Over the next thirty-plus years, though, it became a different place&#8212;kinder and meaner, richer and poorer, more like America and less like what it had always been.<BR> <BR><i>New York, New York, New York</i>, Thomas Dyja&rsquo;s sweeping account of this metamorphosis, shows it wasn&rsquo;t the work of a single policy, mastermind, or economic theory, nor was it a morality tale of gentrification or crime. Instead, three New Yorks evolved in turn. After brutal retrenchment came the dazzling Koch Renaissance and the Dinkins years that left the city&rsquo;s liberal traditions battered but laid the foundation for the safe streets and dotcom excess of Giuliani&rsquo;s Reformation in the &lsquo;90s. Then the planes hit on 9/11. The shaky city handed itself over to Bloomberg who merged City Hall into his personal empire, launching its Reimagination. From Hip Hop crews to Wall Street bankers, D.V. to Jay-Z, Dyja weaves New Yorkers famous, infamous, and unknown&#8212;Yuppies, hipsters, tech nerds, and artists; community organizers and the immigrants who made this a truly global place&#8212;into a narrative of a city creating ways of life that would ultimately change cities everywhere.<BR> <BR>With great success, though, came grave mistakes. The urbanism that reclaimed public space became a means of control, the police who made streets safe became an occupying army, technology went from a means to the end. Now, as anxiety fills New Yorker&rsquo;s hearts and empties its public spaces, it&rsquo;s clear that what brought the city back&#8212;proximity, density, and human exchange&#8212;are what sent Covid-19 burning through its streets, and the price of order has come due. A fourth evolution is happening and we must understand that the greatest challenge ahead is the one New York failed in the first three: The cures must not be worse than the disease.<BR> <BR>Exhaustively researched, passionately told, <i>New York, New York, New York</i> is a colorful, inspiring guide to not just rebuilding but <i>reimagining</i> a great city.]]></d104>

Corn is a telegenic, perfect candidate&#8212;yet harbors secrets that threaten him. The group&rsquo;s goal is to implement their own foreign policy and fundamentally restructure American society. Essential to this scheme is Greta Webb, a sophisticated and beautiful CIA agent who is an expert on how global dark money flows, not to mention skilled in lethal hand-to-hand combat.<BR> <BR>To achieve their goals, they form dangerous alliances. One is with a woman who manages the largest, and most corrupt, private pool of capital that has ever existed. And another with the brilliant, ruthless founder of Russia&rsquo;s most successful private military company: a mercenary&rsquo;s mercenary, who has ties to Vladimir Putin. He has his eye on Greta Webb&#8212;and while she would be wise to avoid him at all costs, she cannot.<BR> <BR>Journeying across the globe from New York to Washington to Middle Eastern war zones to wine cellars in the French countryside to Putin&rsquo;s private restaurant in St. Petersburg, the group of Americans become enmeshed in this underground world. And as they discover the secret of the dark money&rsquo;s pool&rsquo;s success&#8212;which involves manipulating the markets to rake in billions of dollars&#8212;they come into ever increasing danger. Ultimately the team of Americans must decide whether their ultimate objectives are worth the cost of ruthlessly sacrificing not just a few but potentially many human lives. <BR> <BR>Brilliantly told and filled with jaw-dropping action and unforgettable characters, <i>Undermoney</i> offers a savage look at the secret lives of the world&rsquo;s richest people.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>A sweeping memoir of American politics and history from Chris Matthews, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author and former host of MSNBC&rsquo;s <i>Hardball with Chris Matthews</i>.</b><BR><BR>In <i>This Country</i>, Chris Matthews offers a panoramic portrait of post&#8211;World War II America through the story of his remarkable life and career. It is a story of risk and adventure, of self-reliance and service, of loyalty and friendship. It is a story driven by an abiding faith in our country.<BR> <BR>Raised in a large Irish-Catholic family in Philadelphia at a time when kids hid under their desks in atomic war drills, Chris&rsquo;s life etched a pattern: take a leap, live an adventure, then learn what it means. As a young Peace Corps graduate, Chris moved to DC and began knocking on doors on Capitol Hill. With dreams of becoming what Ted Sorensen had been for Jack Kennedy, Chris landed as a staffer to Utah Senator Frank Moss, where his eyes were opened to the game of big-league politics.<BR> <BR>In the 1970s, Matthews mounted a campaign for Congress as a Democratic maverick running against Philadelphia&rsquo;s old political machine. He didn&rsquo;t win the most votes, but his grit put him on the path to a top job in the White House. As a speechwriter for President Carter, Matthews witnessed the triumphs and tragedies of that administration; from the diplomatic brilliance of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty to the disaster of the Iran hostage crisis. After Carter&rsquo;s defeat, Chris became chief of staff to legendary Speaker of the House Tip O&rsquo;Neill, a perch that gave him an on-the-job PhD in American politics during the Reagan years.<BR> <BR>Chris then leapt to the other side of the political matrix as a columnist and reporter. For the <i>San Francisco Examiner</i>, he covered the fall of the Berlin Wall, the first all-races election in South Africa, the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, and every American presidency from Reagan to George W. Bush. Chris would go on to pioneer cable news with a fast-paced, no-nonsense television program. His show, <i>Hardball with Chris Matthews</i>, would become a political institution for twenty years.<BR> <BR>As Chris charts his political odyssey, he paints an energetic picture of a nation searching for its soul. He reflects with grace and wisdom, showcasing the grand arc of the American story through one life dedicated to its politics.]]></d104>

The stories within this collection portray love, desire, BDSM, and sexual kinks in all their glory with a bold new vision. The collection includes works by renowned fiction writers such as Callum Angus, Alexander Chee, Vanessa Clark, Melissa Febos, Kim Fu, Roxane Gay, Cara Hoffman, Zeyn Joukhadar, Chris Kraus, Carmen Maria Machado, Peter Mountford, Larissa Pham, and Brandon Taylor, with Garth Greenwell and R.O.

While there are whips and chains, sure, the true power of these stories lies in their beautiful, moving dispatches from across the sexual spectrum of interest and desires, as portrayed by some of today&rsquo;s most exciting writers.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>The </b><i><b>New York Times</b></i><b> bestselling author of </b><i><b>The Unhoneymooners </b></i><b>returns with a witty and effervescent novel about what happens when two people with everything on the line are thrown together by science&#8212;or is it fate? </b><b>P</b><b>erfect for fans of </b><i><b>The Rosie Project</b></i><b> and </b><i><b>One Plus One</b></i><b>.</b><BR><BR>Single mom Jess Davis is a data and statistics wizard, but no amount of number crunching can convince her to step back into the dating world. Raised by her grandparents&#8212;who now help raise her seven-year-old daughter, Juno&#8212;Jess has been left behind too often to feel comfortable letting anyone in. After all, her father&rsquo;s never been around, her hard-partying mother disappeared when she was six, and her ex decided he wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;father material&rdquo; before Juno was even born. Jess holds her loved ones close, but working constantly to stay afloat is hard...and lonely.<BR> <BR>But then Jess hears about GeneticAlly, a buzzy new DNA-based matchmaking company that&rsquo;s predicted to change dating forever. Finding a soulmate through DNA? The reliability of numbers<i>:</i> <i>This </i>Jess understands.<BR> <BR>At least she thought she did, until her test shows an unheard-of 98% compatibility with another subject in the database: GeneticAlly&rsquo;s founder, Dr. River Pe&#241;a. This is one number she can&rsquo;t wrap her head around, because she already knows Dr. Pe&#241;a. The stuck-up, stubborn man is without a doubt <i>not</i> her soulmate. But GeneticAlly has a proposition: Get to know him and we&rsquo;ll pay you. Jess&#8212;who is barely making ends meet&#8212;is in no position to turn it down, despite her skepticism about the project and her dislike for River. As the pair are dragged from one event to the next as the &ldquo;Diamond&rdquo; pairing that could make GeneticAlly a mint in stock prices, Jess begins to realize that there might be more to the scientist&#8212;and the science behind a soulmate&#8212;than she thought.<BR> <BR>Funny, warm, and full of heart, <i>The Soulmate Equation </i>proves that the delicate balance between fate and choice can never be calculated.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>From the host of the popular WNYC podcast <i>Death, Sex, & Money, Let&rsquo;s Talk About Hard Things</i> is an invitation to discuss the tough topics that all of us encounter.</b><BR><BR>Anna Sale wants you to have <i>that </i>conversation. You know the one. The one that you&rsquo;ve been avoiding or putting off, maybe for years. The one that you&rsquo;ve thought &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll never understand&rdquo; or &ldquo;do I really want to bring <i>that </i>up?&rdquo; or &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not going to go well, so why even try?&rdquo;<BR> <BR>Sale is the founder and host of WNYC&rsquo;s popular, award-winning podcast <i>Death, Sex, & Money</i>, or as the <i>New York Times </i>dubbed her, &ldquo;a therapist at happy hour.&rdquo; She and her guests have direct and thought-provoking conversations, discussing topics that most of us are too squeamish, polite, or nervous to bring up. But Sale argues that we all experience these hard things, and by not talking to one another, we cut ourselves off, leading us to feel isolated and disconnected from the people who can help us most.<BR> <BR>In <i>Let&rsquo;s Talk About Hard Things,</i> Sale uses the best of what she&rsquo;s learned from her podcast to reveal that when we have the courage to talk about hard things, we learn about ourselves, others, and the world that we make together. Diving into five of the most fraught conversation topics&#8212;death, sex, money, family, and identity&#8212;she moves between memoir, fascinating snapshots of a variety of Americans opening up about their lives, and expert opinions to show why having tough conversations is important and how to do them in a thoughtful and generous way. She uncovers that listening may be the most important part of a tough conversation, that the end goal should be understanding without the pressure of reconciliation, and that there are some things that words can&rsquo;t fix (and why that&rsquo;s actually okay).<BR> <BR>Touching, personal, and inspiring, <i>Let's Talk About Hard Things</i> is a profound meditation on why communication can connect us instead of divide us and how we can all do it better.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>A wedding harpist disillusioned with love and a hopeless romantic cater-waiter flirt and fight their way through a summer of weddings in this effervescent romantic comedy from the acclaimed author of <i>Today Tonight Tomorrow.</i></b><BR><BR>Quinn Berkowitz and Tarek Mansour&rsquo;s families have been in business together for years: Quinn&rsquo;s parents are wedding planners, and Tarek&rsquo;s own a catering company. At the end of last summer, Quinn confessed her crush on him in the form of a rambling email&#8212;and then he left for college without a response.<BR> <BR>Quinn has been dreading seeing him again almost as much as she dreads another summer playing the harp for her parents&rsquo; weddings. When he shows up at the first wedding of the summer, looking cuter than ever after a year apart, they clash immediately. Tarek&rsquo;s always loved the grand gestures in weddings&#8212;the flashier, the better&#8212;while Quinn can&rsquo;t see them as anything but fake. Even as they can&rsquo;t seem to have one civil conversation, Quinn&rsquo;s thrown together with Tarek wedding after wedding, from performing a daring cake rescue to filling in for a missing bridesmaid and groomsman.<BR> <BR>Quinn can&rsquo;t deny her feelings for him are still there, especially after she learns the truth about his silence, opens up about her own fears, and begins learning the art of harp-making from an enigmatic teacher.<BR> <BR>Maybe love isn&rsquo;t the enemy after all&#8212;and maybe allowing herself to fall is the most honest thing Quinn&rsquo;s ever done.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>From <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Mary Alice Monroe comes a beautiful story of friendship, loss, and the healing power of nature in her first book for middle grade readers.</b><BR><BR>Eleven-year-old Jake&rsquo;s life has just turned upside-down. His father was wounded in Afghanistan, and his mother is going to leave to care for him. That means Jake&rsquo;s spending the summer on tiny Dewees Island with his grandmother. The island is a nature sanctuary&#8212;no cars or paved roads, no stores or restaurants. To make matters worse, Jake&rsquo;s grandmother doesn&rsquo;t believe in cable or the internet. Which means Jake has no cell phone, no video games...and no friends. This is going to be the worst summer ever!<BR> <BR>He&rsquo;s barely on the island before he befriends two other kids&#8212;Macon, another &ldquo;summer kid,&rdquo; and Lovie, know-it-all who lives there and shows both Jake and Macon the ropes of life on the island. All three are struggling with their own family issues and they quickly bond, going on adventures all over Dewees Island. Until one misadventure on an abandoned boat leads to community service. Their punishment? Mandatory duty on the Island Turtle Team. The kids must do a daily dawn patrol of the beach on the hunt for loggerhead sea turtle tracks. When a turtle nest is threatened by coyotes, the three friends must find a way to protect it. Can they save the turtle nest from predators? Can Jake&rsquo;s growing love for the island and its inhabitants (be they two-legged, four-legged, feathered, or finned) help to heal his father?]]></d104>

Mallory states her case for action in this searing indictment of America&rsquo;s historical, deadly, and continuing assault on Black and brown lives.</b><BR><BR>Drawn from a lifetime of frontline culture-shifting advocacy, organizing, and fighting for equal justice, <i>State of Emergency</i> makes Mallory&rsquo;s demand for change and shares the keys to effective activism both for those new to and long-committed to the defense of Black lives. <BR> <BR>From Minneapolis to Louisville, to Portland, Kenosha, and Washington, DC, America&rsquo;s reckoning with its unmet promises on race and class is at a boiling point not seen since the 1960s. While conversations around pathways to progress take place on social media and cable TV, history tells us that meaningful change only comes with radical legislation and boots-on-the-ground activism. Here, Mallory shares her unique personal experience building coalitions, speaking truth to power, and winning over hearts and minds in the struggle for shared prosperity and safety. <BR> <BR>Forward-looking, steeped in history, and rich with stories from life on the margins of American life, <i>State of Emergency </i>is a revelatory examination of the challenges we face, of the forces we must overcome, and a blueprint for all who maintain hope for social equity and a better tomorrow.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>From an award-winning science journalist, a lively, informative, and humorous deep dive into the future of the toilet&#8212;from creative uses for harvested &ldquo;biosolids,&rdquo; to the bold engineers dedicated to bringing safe sanitation to the billions of people worldwide living without&#8212;for fans of popular science bestsellers by Mary Roach. </b><BR><BR>Most of us do not give much thought to the centerpiece of our bathrooms, but the toilet is an unexpected paradox. On the one hand, it is a modern miracle: a ubiquitous fixture in a vast sanitation system that has helped add decades to human lifespan by reducing disease. On the other hand, the toilet is also a tragic failure: less than half of the world&rsquo;s population can access a toilet that safely manages bodily waste, including many right here in the United States. And it is inefficient, squandering clean water as well as the nutrients and energy contained in the waste we flush away. While we see radical technological change in almost every other aspect of our lives, we remain stuck in a sanitation status quo&#8212;in part because the topic of toilets is taboo.<BR> <BR>Fortunately, there&rsquo;s hope&#8212;and <i>Pipe Dreams </i>daringly profiles the growing army of scientists, engineers, philanthropists, entrepreneurs, and activists worldwide who are overcoming their aversions and focusing their formidable skills on making toilets accessible and healthier for all.<BR> <BR>This potential revolution in sanitation has many benefits, including reducing inequalities, mitigating climate change and water scarcity, improving agriculture, and optimizing health. Author Chelsea Wald takes us on a wild world tour from a compost toilet project in Haiti, to a plant in the Netherlands that harvests used toilet paper from sewage, and shows us a bot that hangs out in manholes to estimate opioid use in a city, among many other fascinating developments.<BR> <BR>Much more than a glorified trash can, the toilet, Wald maintains, holds the power to help solve many of the world&rsquo;s problems, if only we can harness it.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>Andrew Sullivan&#8212;youngest ever editor of </b><b><i>The New Republic, </i></b><b>founding editor of <i>The Daily Dish</i></b><b>, hailed as &ldquo;one of the most influential journalists of the last three decades&rdquo; by <i>The New York Times</i>&#8212;presents a collection of his most iconic and powerful essays of social and political commentary from <i>The New Republic, The Atlantic, The </i><i>New York Times Magazine, New York </i>magazine, and more.</b><BR><BR>Over the course of his career, Andrew Sullivan has never shied away from staking out bold positions on social and political issues. A fiercely independent conservative, in 1989 he wrote the first national cover story in favor of marriage equality, and then an essay, &ldquo;The Politics of Homosexuality,&rdquo; in <i>The New Republic</i> in 1993, an article called the most consequential of the decade in the gay rights movement. A pioneer of online journalism, he started blogging in 2000 and helped define the new medium with his blog, <i>The Daily Dish</i>. In 2007, he was one of the first political writers to champion the presidential campaign of Barack Obama, and his cover story for <i>The Atlantic</i>, &ldquo;Why Obama Matters,&rdquo; was seen as a milestone in that campaign&rsquo;s messaging. In the past five years, he has proved a vocal foe both of Donald Trump and of wokeness on the left. Loved and loathed by both left and right, Sullivan is in a tribe of one.<BR> <BR>Bold, timely, and thought-provoking, this collection of Sullivan&rsquo;s greatest arguments on culture, politics, religion, and philosophy demonstrates why he continues to be ranked among the most intriguing and salient figures in US media.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>When a teenaged girl disappears from an insular small town, all of the community&rsquo;s most devastating secrets come to light in this stunningly atmospheric and slow-burning suspense novel&#8212;perfect for fans of Megan Miranda and Celeste Ng.</b><BR><BR>The town of Whistling Ridge guards its secrets.<BR> <BR>When seventeen-year-old Abigail goes missing, her best friend Emma, compelled by the guilt of leaving her alone at a party in the woods, sets out to discover the truth about what happened. The police initially believe Abi ran away, but Emma doesn't believe that her friend would leave without her, and when officers find disturbing evidence in the nearby woods, the festering secrets and longstanding resentment of both Abigail&rsquo;s family and the people of Whistling Ridge, Colorado begin to surface with devastating consequences.<BR> <BR>Among those secrets: Abi's older brother Noah&rsquo;s passionate, dangerous love for the handsome Rat, a recently arrived Romanian immigrant who has recently made his home in the trailer park in town; her younger brother Jude's feeling that he knows information he should tell the police, if only he could put it into words; Abi's father's mercurial, unpredictable rages and her mother's silence. Then there is the rest of Whistling Ridge, where a charismatic preacher advocates for God's love in language that mirrors violence, under the sway of the powerful businessman who rules the town, insular and wary of outsiders.<BR> <BR>But Abi had secrets, too, and the closer Emma grows to unraveling the past, the farther she feels from her friend. And in a tinder box of small-town rage, and all it will take is just one spark&#8212;the truth of what really happened that night&#8212;to change their community forever.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>The definitive book about America&rsquo;s perpetual wars and how to end them from bestselling author, military expert, and award-winning journalist William M. Arkin.</b><BR><BR>The first rule of perpetual war is to never stop, a fact which former NBC News analyst William M. Arkin knows better than anyone, having served in the Army and having covered all of America&rsquo;s wars over the past three decades. He has spent his career investigating how the military throws around the word &ldquo;war&rdquo; to justify everything, from physical combat to today&rsquo;s globe-straddling cyber and intelligence network.<BR> <BR>In <i>The Generals Have No Clothes</i>, Arkin traces how we got where we are&#8212;bombing ten countries, killing terrorists in dozens more&#8212;all without Congressional approval or public knowledge. Starting after the 9/11 attacks, the government put forth a singular idea that perpetual war was the only way to keep the American people safe. Arkin explains why President Obama failed to achieve his national security goal of ending war in Iraq and reducing our military engagements, and shows how President Trump has been frustrated in his attempts to end conflict in Afghanistan and Syria. He also reveals how COVID-19 is a watershed moment for the military, where the country&rsquo;s civilian and public health needs clash with the demands of future wars against China and Russia, North Korea and Iran.<BR> <BR>Proposing bold solutions, Arkin calls for a new era of civilian control over the military. He also calls for a Global Security Index (GSX), the security equivalent to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which would measure the national and international events in real time to determine whether perpetual war is actually making the nation safer. Arguing that the American people should be empowered by facts rather than spurred by fear, <i>The Generals Have No Clothes</i> outlines how we can take control of the military&hellip;before it&rsquo;s too late.]]></d104>

Ly&rsquo;s father, a former lieutenant in the South Vietnamese army, spent nearly a decade as a POW, and their resettlement is made possible through a humanitarian program run by the US government. Soon after they arrive, Ly joins her parents and three older brothers in sewing ties and cummerbunds piecemeal on their living room floor to make ends meet.<BR><BR>As they navigate this new landscape, Ly finds herself torn between two worlds. She knows she must honor her parents&rsquo; Buddhist faith and contribute to the family livelihood, working long hours at home and then later as a manicurist alongside her mother at a nail salon in Brownsville, Brooklyn, which her parents eventually take over. But at school, Ly feels the mounting pressure to blend in.<BR><BR>A growing inability to see the blackboard presents new challenges, especially when her father forbids her from getting glasses, calling her diagnosis of poor vision a government conspiracy. His frightening temper and paranoia leave an indelible mark on Ly&rsquo;s sense of self. Who is she outside of everything her family expects of her?<BR><BR>Told in a spare, evocative voice that, with flashes of humor, weaves together her family&rsquo;s immigration experience with her own fraught and courageous coming-of-age, <i>House of Sticks </i>is a timely and powerful portrait of one girl&rsquo;s struggle to reckon with her heritage and forge her own path.<BR><BR><b>Topics & Questions for Discussion</b><BR><BR>1. Consider the Vietnamese proverb at the beginning of the book and compare it to the dedication. How does this help you understand Ly&rsquo;s family dynamics as you read?<BR><BR>2. There are several chapters where water or oceans are featured, such as &ldquo;Water and Angels,&rdquo; &ldquo;In the Swim,&rdquo; and the final chapter, &ldquo;Almost There.&rdquo; What role do oceans and water play throughout the book on a metaphoric and literal level?<BR><BR>3. Ly&rsquo;s parents tend to rely on Buddhism in their struggles and instruct Ly to pray when she faces difficulty. In what ways does Buddhism influence Ly throughout her life? How does her relationship to it change?<BR><BR>4. At one point early in Ly&rsquo;s childhood, her mother takes on a nanny job for a Vietnamese couple with a one-year-old boy named Cuong. Ly and her brothers then see &ldquo;how the other half lives&rdquo;&#8212;very different from their own existence. What does this chapter add to the story?<BR><BR>5. What is the difference between the way Ly&rsquo;s older brother Thinh deals with conflict with their father versus the way Ly deals with conflict? Why do you think this is?<BR><BR>6. Growing up, Ly struggles to understand relationships and sexuality. Initially, her mother tells her not to think about it, and Ly, as a young girl, says she will never get married. As she matures, she experiences sexual harassment, which further rattles her understanding of attraction. Can you describe Ly&rsquo;s journey of understanding in regards to sex and sexuality?<BR><BR>7. Throughout the book, Ly&rsquo;s mother seems to be a quietly stable character, supporting both her husband and children. The one moment she has an outburst is when she laughs bitterly when Ly&rsquo;s father yells at them for calling the police on a customer who left without paying. What do you make of Ly&rsquo;s mother as an individual? What do you think about the relationship between her and Ly?<BR><BR>8. In the chapter &ldquo;Betrayed by Our Tongues,&rdquo; Ly references the American dream after facing racism and harassment. She wants to promise her family will achieve it but is disheartened. Yet, in what ways is this experience, the immigrant experience, a quintessentially American story?<BR><BR>9. In the chapter &ldquo;A Lazy, No-Good Daughter,&rdquo; Ly&rsquo;s teacher Ms. Walsh calls the Administration for Children&rsquo;s Services (ACS) to report Ly&rsquo;s parents for child neglect since her father refuses to allow Ly to get glasses. This triggers Ly&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s PTSD, widens the rift between her and her parents, and worsens her own mental health. Still, Ms. Walsh says, &ldquo;If I had to do it again, I would.&rdquo; Discuss the source of the conflict here and if there could have been a better outcome. What would you have done in Ms. Walsh&rsquo;s position? In Ly&rsquo;s?<BR><BR>10. Though Ly is initially excited about going to college and finding new experiences, her mental health starts to decline because of her feelings of guilt for leaving her parents behind. Why do you think Ly struggles in particular with these feelings?<BR><BR>11. Think about the relationship between Ly and her brothers. Oftentimes when she cannot go to her parents, her brothers step in financially. At the same time, there is a certain distance between Ly and her brothers as they grow older. Why do you think their relationships fell into that pattern?<BR><BR>12. Ly experiences a second traumatic event at the hands of a well-meaning authority figure when she is taken to a psychiatric hospital without notice or explanation. There, she meets several people she makes a connection with, but is rattled all the while. Discuss Ly&rsquo;s experiences and if anything surprised you. How might mental health patients be better served?<BR><BR>13. After Ly is dismissed from the Honors College, she meets Joseph and begins a romantic relationship with him, the first we&rsquo;ve seen her experience. In what ways is Joseph a grounding and supportive figure for Ly? What does their relationship add to her life that she has not previously experienced?<BR><BR>14. Though Ly&rsquo;s journey in education has its challenges, her efforts culminate in getting accepted to Columbia. She makes it clear she approaches her education there differently, prioritizing self-care over perfect grades. What can we, as individuals and as a society, learn from her experiences?<BR><BR>15. The defining conflict between Ly and her father is over her struggling eyesight. She must often resort to outside help and hide it from her father. However, in the end, her father offers to pay for LASIK surgery. Discuss this moment and what may have contributed to her father&rsquo;s reaching this point of understanding. What does this do for your understanding of her father as a complex individual?<BR><BR>16. There are many voices featured in this memoir: Ly&rsquo;s voice, her mother&rsquo;s voice, and her father&rsquo;s voice in particular. As Ly comes to understand her journey, she also moves from a position of voicelessness, where she struggles to articulate her experiences, to a place where she can speak freely about the events of her life. Which of the voices in <i>House of Sticks</i> resonated with you the most? Can you think of a turning point for Ly in being able to speak or write about her journey?<BR><BR><b>Enhance Your Book Club </b><BR><BR>1. There are several monuments around the world and within the United States commemorating the perilous journey and the people who died escaping Vietnam. Do your own research and try to find one near you, if possible. Interesting fact: There is one in Des Moines, Iowa!<BR><BR>2. Try taking a practice nail tech and/or manicurist exam online. You can find one for your state or a general practice exam. For example, you can try the New York Nail Technician state board exam here: https://cosmetologypracticetest.guru/new-york-nail-technician-license/.<BR><BR>3.

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>For readers of <i>Atomic Habits</i>, <i>Deep Work</i>, and <i>Peak</i> comes a game-changing approach to mastering new skills and succeeding faster: reverse engineering.</b><BR><BR>For generations, we&rsquo;ve been taught there are two ways to succeed&#8212;either from talent or practice. In <i>Decoding Greatness</i>, award-winning social psychologist Ron Friedman illuminates a powerful third path&#8212;one that has quietly launched icons in a wide range of fields, from artists, writers, and chefs, to athletes, inventors, and entrepreneurs: reverse engineering.<BR> <BR>To reverse engineer is to look beyond what is evident on the surface and find a hidden structure. It&rsquo;s the ability to taste an intoxicating dish and deduce its recipe, to listen to a beautiful song and discern its chord progression, to watch a horror film and grasp its narrative arc. <BR> <BR>Using eye-opening examples of top performers&#8212;from Agatha Christie to Andy Warhol, Barack Obama to Serena Williams&#8212;and groundbreaking research on pattern recognition, skill acquisition, and creative genius, Friedman reveals the staggering power of reverse engineering and teaches you how to harness this vital skill for yourself.<BR> <BR>You&rsquo;ll learn how to take apart models you admire, pinpoint precisely what makes them work, and apply that knowledge to develop novel ideas, methods, and products that are uniquely your own. Along the way, you&rsquo;ll meet the culinary detective who exposes top-secret recipes, the burglar who can visit a bank and recreate its blueprints, and the celebrated artist who reverse engineered his way to the top of his profession without any formal education.<BR> <BR>Bursting with unforgettable stories and actionable strategies, <i>Decoding Greatness</i> is an indispensable guide to learning from the best, improving your skills, and sparking breakthrough ideas.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>A lyrical novel set against the backdrop of China&rsquo;s Cultural Revolution that follows a father&rsquo;s quest to reunite his family before his precocious daughter&rsquo;s momentous birthday, which Garth Greenwell calls &ldquo;one of the most beautiful debuts I&rsquo;ve read in years.&rdquo;</b><BR><BR><i>How many times in life can we start over without losing ourselves?</i><BR> <BR>In the summer of 1986 in a small Chinese village, ten-year-old Junie receives a momentous letter from her parents, who had left for America years ago: her father promises to return home and collect her by her twelfth birthday. But Junie&rsquo;s growing determination to stay put in the idyllic countryside with her beloved grandparents threatens to derail her family&rsquo;s shared future.<BR> <BR>What Junie doesn&rsquo;t know is that her parents, Momo and Cassia, are newly estranged from one another in their adopted country, each holding close private tragedies and histories from the tumultuous years of their youth during China&rsquo;s Cultural Revolution. While Momo grapples anew with his deferred musical ambitions and dreams for Junie&rsquo;s future in America, Cassia finally begins to wrestle with a shocking act of brutality from years ago. In order for Momo to fulfill his promise, he must make one last desperate attempt to reunite all three members of the family before Junie&rsquo;s birthday&#8212;even if it means bringing painful family secrets to light.<BR> <BR>&ldquo;A beautifully written, poignant exploration of family, art, culture, immigration, and most of all, love,&rdquo; (Jean Kwok, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Searching for Sylvie Lee</i>) <i>Swimming Back to Trout River </i>weaves together the stories of Junie, Momo, Cassia, and Dawn&#8212;a talented violinist from Momo&rsquo;s past&#8212;while depicting their heartbreak and resilience, tenderly revealing the hope, compromises, and abiding ingenuity that make up the lives of immigrants.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b><i>Pretty Mess </i></b><b>meets <i>#Girlboss </i>in this part memoir, part entrepreneurial manifesto from <i>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</i>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Powerhouse in Pigtails.&rdquo;</b><BR><BR>Margaret Josephs is a hustler. She&rsquo;s a tough cookie. She speaks her mind. She <i>never</i> leaves the house without lipstick on. She&rsquo;s also a devoted wife, mother, daughter, businesswoman, lifestyle expert, and fan-favorite star of the reality TV series <i>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</i>. Sounds pretty glamorous, right? Well, things are never exactly as they seem.<BR> <BR>Before she arrived where she is today, &ldquo;The Marge&rdquo; was born to young immigrant parents. Raised by a single party-girl mother who left her physically abusive father when she was one and a half, she was taught that it was more important to look good than to feel good. No structure. No rules. No blueprint for future success or stability. But like most people who struggle through atypical childhoods, destructive relationships, and career challenges, she forced herself to wake up every morning and put one high heel in front of the other, even if she didn&rsquo;t know where she was going.<BR> <BR>Margaret took the cards she was dealt and eventually turned them into a winning hand, and she wants to arm fans with the ability to do the same. In <i>Caviar Dreams, Tuna Fish Budget</i>, she&rsquo;ll talk about how to launch a lifestyle brand, how to work with family members, and how to be an uncompromising woman in a man&rsquo;s world. She also spills stories from her personal life about the son <i>Real Housewives</i> viewers don&rsquo;t know exists, the time Joan Rivers gave her the best advice she ever got, the rendezvous she had with a famous rock star, and the affair with her contractor that ended her marriage but gave her the happily ever after.<BR> <BR><i>Caviar Dreams, Tuna Fish Budget</i> takes readers along Margaret&rsquo;s wild, bumpy journey to entrepreneurial success and reality TV fame, written in her trademark no-nonsense, tongue-in-cheek voice with the perfect combination of grit and glitz.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>A sweeping and lively history of one of the most dramatic stories never told&#8212;of the greatest railroad war of all time, fought by the daring leaders of the Santa Fe and the Rio Grande to seize, control, and create the American West. </b><BR><BR>It is remarkable now to imagine, but during the 1870s, the American West, for all its cloud-topped peaks and endless coastline, might have been barren tundra as far as most Americans knew. In 1869, the first transcontinental railroad had made history by linking East and West, but, relying heavily on federal grants, it left an opening for two brash new railroad men, the Civil War hero behind the Rio Grande and the corporate chieftain of the Santa Fe, to build the first transcontinental to make money by creating a railroad empire across the Southwest to the sea.<BR> <BR>The railroad companies were governments on wheels: they set the course, chose the route, and built up cities and towns along their tracks. Their choices brought life to such out-of-the-way places as San Diego, Santa Fe, Albuquerque, Denver, and to Los Angeles most of all: The Santa Fe turned a sleepy backwater of 30,000 into a booming metropolis of 150,000 in three years&#8212;the most explosive growth of any city in the history of the United States.<BR> <BR>By then, the two men behind the Rio Grande and the Santa Fe had fought all across the west to lay claim to the routes that would secure the most profitable territory and the richest silver mines. But they often led through narrow mountain passes or up treacherous canyons with room for only a single set of tracks. To win them, each side turned hundreds of their train workers into private armies backed by local militia and paid mercenaries like Dodge City&rsquo;s Bat Masterson. The war left one of the two lines reeling in a death spiral and sent the other on to a greatness unequaled by any other railroad in the world.<BR> <BR><i>From the River to the Sea</i> is the epic story of the greatest railroad war of all time, fought by two railroad men for glory and fortune&#8212;and the right to shape the future of the West.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>Globe-trotting golfer Tom Coyne has finally come home. And he&rsquo;s ready to play all of it. </b><BR> <BR> <b>After playing hundreds of courses overseas in the birthplace of golf, &#8203;Coyne, the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>A Course Called Ireland</i> and <i>A Course Called Scotland</i>, returns to his own birthplace and delivers a rollicking love letter to golf in the United States.</b><BR><BR>In the span of one unforgettable year, Coyne crisscrosses the country in search of its greatest golf experience, playing every course to ever host a US Open, along with more than two hundred hidden gems and heavyweights, visiting all fifty states to find a better understanding of his home country and countrymen.<BR> <BR>Coyne&rsquo;s journey begins where the US Open and US Amateur got their start, historic Newport Country Club in Rhode Island. As he travels from the oldest and most elite of links to the newest and most democratic, Coyne finagles his way onto coveted first tees (Shinnecock, Oakmont, Chicago GC) between rounds at off-the-map revelations, like ranch golf in Eastern Oregon and homemade golf in the Navajo Nation. He marvels at the golf miracle hidden in the sand hills of Nebraska, and plays an unforgettable midnight game under bright sunshine on the summer solstice in Fairbanks, Alaska.<BR> <BR>More than just a tour of the best golf the United States has to offer, Coyne&rsquo;s quest connects him with hundreds of American golfers, each from a different background but all with one thing in common: pride in welcoming Coyne to their course. Trading stories and swing tips with caddies, pros, and golf buddies for the day, Coyne adopts the wisdom of one of his hosts in Minnesota: the best courses are the ones you play with the best people.<BR> <BR>But, in the end, only one stop on Coyne&rsquo;s journey can be ranked the Great American Golf Course. Throughout his travels, he invites golfers to debate and help shape his criteria for judging the quintessential American course. Should it be charmingly traditional or daringly experimental? An architectural showpiece or a natural wonder? Countless conversations and gut instinct lead him to seek out a course that feels bold and idealistic, welcoming yet imperfect, with a little revolutionary spirit and a damn good hot dog at the turn. He discovers his long-awaited answer in the most unlikely of places.<BR> <BR>Packed with fascinating tales from American golf history, comic road misadventures, illuminating insights into course design, and many a memorable round with local golfers and celebrity guests alike, <i>A Course Called America</i> is an epic narrative travelogue brimming with heart and soul.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>An immersive account of a tragedy at sea whose repercussions haunt its survivors to this day, lauded by </b><i><b>New York Times</b></i><b> bestselling author Ron Suskind as &ldquo;an honest and touching book, and a hell of a story.&rdquo;</b><BR><BR>In March of 1984, the commercial fishing boat <i>Wind Blown</i> left Montauk Harbor on what should have been a routine offshore voyage. Its captain, a married father of three young boys, was the boat&rsquo;s owner and leader of the four-man crew, which included two locals and the blue-blooded son of a well-to-do summer family. After a week at sea, the weather suddenly turned, and the foursome collided with a nor&rsquo;easter. They soon found themselves in the fight of their lives. Tragically, it was a fight they lost. Neither the boat nor the bodies of the men were ever recovered.<BR> <BR>The fate of the <i>Wind Blown</i>&#8212;the second-worst nautical disaster suffered by a Montauk-based fishing vessel in over a hundred years&#8212;has become interwoven with the local folklore of the East End&rsquo;s year-round population. Back then, on the easternmost tip of Long Island, before Wall Street and hedge fund money stormed into town, commercial fishing was the area&rsquo;s economic lifeblood.<BR> <BR>Amanda M. Fairbanks examines the profound shift of Montauk from a working-class village&#8212;&ldquo;a drinking town with a fishing problem&rdquo;&#8212;to a playground for the ultra-wealthy, seeking out the reasons that an event more than three decades old remains so startlingly vivid in people&rsquo;s minds. She explores the ways in which deep, lasting grief can alter people&rsquo;s memories. And she shines a light on the powerful and sometimes painful dynamics between fathers and sons, as well as the secrets that can haunt families from beyond the grave.<BR> <BR>The story itself is a universal tale of family and brotherhood; it&rsquo;s about what happens when the dreams and ambitions of affluent and working-class families collide. Captivating and powerful, <i>The Lost Boys of Montauk</i> explores one of the most important questions we face as humans: how do memories of the dead inform the lives of those left behind?]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>Using his own journey as inspiration, writer Jon Waldman offers this heartfelt and funny guide for men and couples struggling with infertility. </b><BR><BR>Take a moment to scroll through the contacts on your phone or your friends on Facebook. One in six of them is struggling with infertility. The affected women have most likely reached out to family, close friends, support groups, or online communities. They ask for the help they need, and often get it on behalf of themselves and their partners.<BR> <BR>But men don&rsquo;t always handle infertility well. Regardless of the underlying cause, the inability to conceive naturally can be extremely painful. The resulting feelings of inadequacy, shame, and isolation can change how a man acts towards those closest to him. But Jon Waldman wants to change that.<BR> <BR>In <i>Swimming Aimlessly,</i> Waldman shares his family&rsquo;s infertility story, a years-long, crazy expensive, physically and emotionally exhausting ride. He also speaks with other couples, doctors, and fertility experts, providing not only the latest science, but more intimate advice about the ups and downs of trying to conceive, keeping the partnership healthy, and dealing with the inevitable losses that come&#8212;even when the journey ends in a baby.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>From the critically acclaimed and award&#8209;winning author of <i>Golden Hill</i>, a mesmerizing and boldly inventive novel tracing the infinite possibilities of five lives in the bustling neighborhoods of 20th-century London.</b><BR><BR>Lunchtime on a Saturday, 1944: the Woolworths on Bexford High Street in southeast London receives a delivery of aluminum saucepans. A crowd gathers to see the first new metal in ages&#8212;after all, everything&rsquo;s been melted down for the war effort. An instant later, the crowd is gone; incinerated. Among the shoppers were five young children.<BR> <BR>Who were they? What futures did they lose? This brilliantly constructed novel lets an alternative reel of time run, imagining the life arcs of these five souls as they live through the extraordinary, unimaginable changes of the bustling immensity of twentieth-century London. Their intimate everyday dramas, as sons and daughters, spouses, parents, grandparents; as the separated, the remarried, the bereaved. Through decades of social, sexual, and technological transformation, as bus conductors and landlords, as swindlers and teachers, patients and inmates. Days of personal triumphs, disasters; of second chances and redemption.<BR> <BR>Ingenious and profound, full of warmth and beauty, <i>Light Perpetual</i> illuminates the shapes of experience, the extraordinariness of the ordinary, the mysteries of memory and expectation, and the preciousness of life.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>The never-before-published diaries of Alathea Fitzalan Howard&#8212;who spent her teenaged years living out World War II in Windsor Great Park with her close friends Princess Margaret and Princess Elizabeth, the future queen of the United Kingdom&#8212;provide an extraordinary and intimate look at the British Royal Family.</b><BR><BR>Like so many others in Great Britain, young Alathea Fitzalan Howard&rsquo;s life was turned upside down by the start of the Second World War. Sent to stay with her grandfather at the historic Cumberland Lodge in Windsor Great Park, Alathea found the affection she so craved through her close friendship with the two princesses Elizabeth and Margaret, and their parents King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, her neighbors at nearby Windsor Castle.<BR> <BR>Together, the girls enjoyed parties, cinema evenings, picnics, and more, all recorded in honest and captivating detail in Alathea&rsquo;s diary, which she kept as a constant source of comfort. Day by day, from ages sixteen to twenty-two, she recorded the intimate details of her life with the Royal Family and the anxieties of wartime Britain. Now, published for the first time, these unique diaries unveil a candid and vivid portrait of the British Royal Family and of Princess Elizabeth in particular, the warm, quiet young girl who was already on her journey to her ultimate destiny: the Crown.]]></d104>

In her incredibly candid memoir, the Real Housewife of New York City opens the doors of Blue Stone Manor, her Berkshires sanctuary, welcoming fans into her beloved home.

This is a vulnerable and emotional account of love, motherhood, loss, and the not-entirely-planned adventure from her modest beginnings in the Berkshires to her personal, social, and professional ascent&#8212;told in her trademark manner.<BR> <BR>Chronicling the life of the reality television star, <i>Make It Nice</i> also features life lessons for those who may experience similar challenges, as well as the celebrated hostess&rsquo;s invaluable entertaining tips, all presented with the humor and wit that have &ldquo;oh-so-well made&rdquo; Dorinda Medley a most compelling compilation.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>A new collection showcasing the best of Ernest Hemingway&rsquo;s short stories including his well-known classics, as featured in the magnificent three-part, six-hour PBS documentary by Ken Burns and Lynn Novick&#8212;introduced by award-winning author Tobias Wolff.</b><BR><BR>Ernest Hemingway, a literary icon and considered one of the greatest American writers of all time, is the subject of a major documentary by award-winning filmmakers Ken Burns and Lynn Novick. This intimate portrait of Hemingway&#8212;who brilliantly captured the complexities of the human condition in spare and profound prose, and whose work remains deeply influential in literature and culture&#8212;interweaves a close study of biographical events with excerpts from his work.<BR> <BR><i>The Hemingway Stories</i> features Hemingway&rsquo;s most significant short stories in chronological order, so viewers of the film as well as fans old and new can follow the trajectory of his impressive life and career. Hemingway&rsquo;s beloved classics, such as &ldquo;The Short and Happy Life of Francis Macomber,&rdquo; &ldquo;Up in Michigan,&rdquo; &ldquo;Indian Camp,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Snows of Kilimanjaro,&rdquo; are accompanied by fresh insights from renowned writers around the world&#8212;Mario Vargas Llosa, Edna O&rsquo;Brien, Abraham Verghese, Tim O&rsquo;Brien, and Mary Karr. Tobias Wolff's introduction adds a new perspective to Hemingway&rsquo;s work, and Wolff has selected additional stories that demonstrate Hemingway&rsquo;s talent and range.<BR> <BR>The power of Ernest Hemingway&rsquo;s revolutionary style is perhaps most striking in his short stories, and here listeners can encounter the tales that created the legend: stories of men and women in love and in war and on the hunt, stories of a lost generation born into a fractured time. Featuring the voices of Mary Karr, Edna O&rsquo;Brien, Michael Katakis, and other authors whose insights are heard in the PBS documentary, this audio collection is a perfect introduction for a new generation of Hemingway listeners and a vital volume for any fan.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>The uplifting, unlikely, and inspirational true story of the friendships formed between Cam Perron&#8212;a white, baseball-obsessed teenager from Boston&#8212;and hundreds of former professional Negro League players, who were still awaiting the recognition and compensation that they deserved from Major League Baseball more than fifty years after their playing days were over. </b><b>Featuring the players&rsquo; fascinating stories and original photographs.</b><BR><BR>Cam Perron always loved history, and from an early age, he had a knack for collecting. But when he was twelve and bought a set of Topps baseball cards featuring several players from the Negro Leagues, something clicked.<BR> <BR>Cam started writing letters to former Negro League players in 2007, asking for their autographs and a few words about their careers. He got back much more than he expected. The players responded with detailed stories about their glory days on the field, and the racism they faced, including run-ins with the KKK. They explained how they were repeatedly kept out of the major leagues and confined to the historic but lower-paying Negro Leagues, even after Jackie Robinson&#8212;who got his start in the Negro Leagues&#8212;broke the color barrier. By the time Cam finished middle school, letters had turned into phone calls, and he was spending hours a day talking with the players.<BR> <BR>In these conversations, many of the players revealed that their careers had been unrecognized over time, and they&rsquo;d fallen out of touch with their former teammates. So Cam, along with a small group of fellow researchers, organized the first annual Negro League Players Reunion in Birmingham, Alabama in 2010. At the celebratory, week-long event, fifteen-year-old Cam and the players&#8212;who were in their 70s, 80s, and 90s&#8212;finally met in person. They quickly became family.<BR> <BR>As Cam and the players returned to the reunion year after year, Cam became deeply involved in a complicated mission to help many players get pension money that they were owed from Major League Baseball. He also worked to get a Negro League museum opened in Birmingham, and stock it with memorabilia.<BR> <BR>Sports fans&#8212;and anyone who enjoys a heartfelt story&#8212;will have their eyes opened by this book about unlikely friendships, the power of memories, and just how far a childhood interest can go.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>The first major biography of &ldquo;the Thomas Edison of guns,&rdquo; John Moses Browning, a visionary inventor who designed the modern handgun and whose awe-inspiring array of firearms helped ensure victory in numerous American wars and found an important place in American culture. </b><BR><BR>Few people are aware that John Moses Browning&#8212;a tall, humble, cerebral man born in 1855 and raised as a Mormon in the American West&#8212;was the mind behind many of the world-changing firearms that dominated more than a century of conflict. He invented the crucial design used in virtually all modern pistols, created the most popular hunting rifles and shotguns, and conceived the machine guns that proved decisive not just in World Wars I and II but nearly every major military action since. Yet few in America knew his name until he was into his sixties.<BR> <BR>Now, author Nathan Gorenstein brings firearms inventor John Moses Browning to vivid life in this riveting and revealing biography. Embodying the tradition of self-made, self-educated geniuses (like Lincoln and Edison), Browning was able to think in three dimensions (he never used blueprints) and his gifted mind produced everything from the famous Winchester &ldquo;30-30&rdquo; hunting rifle to the awesomely effective machine guns used by every American aircraft and infantry unit in World War II. The British credited Browning&rsquo;s guns with helping to win the Battle of Britain.<BR> <BR>His inventions illustrate both the good and bad of weapons.<BR> <BR>Sweeping, lively, and brilliantly told, this fascinating book introduces a little-known American legend whose impact on history ranks with that of the Wright Brothers, Thomas Edison, and Henry Ford.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>Power isn&rsquo;t just for the few at the top; it is potentially for everyone.</b><BR> <BR> <b>You have power&#8212;and the power to use it.</b><BR><BR>Power is one of the most misunderstood&#8212;and therefore vilified&#8212;concepts in our society. Most people assume power is predetermined by personality or wealth, or that it&rsquo;s gained by strong-arming others. Many write it off as inherently corrupt or &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; and want nothing to do with it. But as pioneering researchers Julie Battilana and Tiziana Casciaro deftly show in <i>Power, for All</i>, power is the ability to influence someone else&rsquo;s behavior. This influence is derived from having access to valued resources, which anyone can have, regardless of their income or status in life. Everyone has a resource to offer, so everyone has access to power.<BR> <BR>Battilana and Casciaro offer a timely, democratized vision of power. While hierarchies tend to stay in place because power is often sticky, by agitating, innovating, and orchestrating change, they show how those with less power can challenge established structures to make them more balanced. They teach readers how to power-map their workplace to find who can create real change at work, plan for and cause sustaining power shifts, and understand the five motivations for seeking power&#8212;money and status, but also autonomy, achievement, affiliation, and morality. They explore how these dynamics play out through vivid storytelling: as Donatella Versace successfully leads her brother&rsquo;s company after his death&#8212;despite having a title, but little influence; what social movements can learn from youth climate activists and how they can go farther; and how a manager can gain the trust of skeptical employees and improve the workplace. Ultimately, <i>Power, for All </i>demystifies the essential mechanisms for acquiring and using power for all people.<BR> <BR>Concentrated, accessible, and life-changing, <i>Power, for All </i>is the definitive guide to understanding and navigating power in our relationships, organizations, and society.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>An acclaimed journalist seeks to understand the mysterious allure of peacocks&#8212;and in the process discovers unexpected and valuable life lessons.</b><BR><BR>When Sean Flynn&rsquo;s neighbor in North Carolina texted &ldquo;Any chance you guys want a peacock? No kidding!&rdquo; he stared bewilderedly at his phone. He had never considered whether he wanted a peacock. But as an award-winning magazine writer, this kind of mystery intrigued him. So he, his wife, and their two young sons became the owners of not one but three charming yet fickle birds: Carl, Ethel, and Mr. Pickle.<BR> <BR>In <i>Why Peacocks?</i>, Flynn chronicles his hilarious and heartwarming first year as a peacock owner, from struggling to build a pen to assisting the local bird doctor in surgery to triumphantly watching a peahen lay her first egg. He also examines the history of peacocks, from their appearance in the Garden of Eden to their befuddling Charles Darwin to their bewitching the likes of Flannery O&rsquo;Connor and Martha Stewart. And fueled by a reporter&rsquo;s curiosity, he travels across the globe to learn more about the birds firsthand, with stops including a Scottish castle where peacocks have resided for centuries, a southern California community tormented by a serial killer of peacocks, and a Kansas City airport hotel hosting an annual gathering of true peafowl aficionados.<BR> <BR>At turns comically absurd and deeply poignant, <i>Why Peacocks?</i> blends lively, insightful memoir and illuminating science journalism to answer the title&rsquo;s question. More than that, it offers surprising lessons about love, grief, fatherhood, and family.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>A &ldquo;dazzling&rdquo; (Bryan Washington, author of </b><i><b>Lot</b></i><b>) and brilliantly satirical debut novel for fans of </b><i><b>Women Talking</b></i><b> and </b><i><b>Red Clocks</b></i><b> about two best friends&#8212;a disgraced influencer and a struggling actor&#8212;who form The Atmosphere, a cult designed to reform problematic men.</b><BR><BR>Sasha Marcus was once the epitome of contemporary success: an internet sensation, social media darling, and a creator of a high profile wellness brand for women. But a confrontation with an abusive troll has taken a horrifying turn, and now she&rsquo;s at rock bottom: canceled and doxxed online, fired from her waitress job and fortressed in her apartment while men&rsquo;s rights protestors rage outside. All that once glittered now condemns.<BR> <BR>Sasha confides in her oldest childhood friend, Dyson&#8212;a failed actor with a history of body issues&#8212;who hatches a plan for Sasha to restore her reputation by becoming the face of his new business venture, The Atmosphere: a rehabilitation community for men. Based in an abandoned summer camp and billed as a workshop for job training, it is actually a rigorous program designed to rid men of their toxic masculinity and heal them physically, emotionally, and socially. Sasha has little choice but to accept. But what horrors await her as the resident female leader of a crew of washed up, desperate men? And what exactly does Dyson want?<BR> <BR>Explosive and wickedly funny, this &ldquo;<i>Fight Club</i> for the millennial generation&rdquo; (Mat Johnson, author of <i>Pym</i>) peers straight into the dark heart of wellness and woke-ness, self-mythology and self-awareness, by asking what happens when we become addicted to the performance of ourselves.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>When a family obsessed with true crime gathers to bury their patriarch, horrifying secrets are exposed upon the discovery of another body in his grave in this chilling novel from the author of <i>Behind the Red Door </i>and <i>The Winter Sister</i>.</b><BR><BR>At twenty-six, Dahlia Lighthouse remains haunted by her upbringing. Raised in a secluded island mansion deep in the woods and kept isolated by her true crime-obsessed parents, she has been unable to move beyond the disappearance of her twin brother, Andy, when they were sixteen.<BR> <BR>After several years away and following her father&rsquo;s death, Dahlia returns to the house where the family soon makes a gruesome discovery: buried in their father&rsquo;s plot is another body&#8212;Andy&rsquo;s, his skull split open with an ax.<BR> <BR>Dahlia is quick to blame Andy&rsquo;s murder on the serial killer who terrorized the island for decades, while the rest of the Lighthouses react to the revelation in unsettling ways. Her brother, Charlie, pours his energy into creating a family memorial museum, highlighting their research into the lives of famous murder victims; her sister, Tate, forges ahead with her popular dioramas portraying crime scenes; and their mother affects a cheerfully domestic facade, becoming unrecognizable as the woman who performed murder reenactments for her children. As Dahlia grapples with her own grief and horror, she realizes that her eccentric family, and the mansion itself, may hold the answers to what happened to her twin.]]></d104>

Jackie Gleason is razzing Toots Shor in Leo Durocher's box seats; J. Edgar Hoover, basking in Sinatra's celebrity, is about to be told that the Russians have tested an atomic bomb; and Russ Hodges, raw-throated and excitable, announces the game -- the Giants and the Dodgers at the Polo Grounds in New York. DeLillo's transcendent account of one of the iconic events of the twentieth century is a masterpiece of American sportswriting.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>From the bestselling author of <i>The Everything Store</i>, an unvarnished picture of Amazon&rsquo;s unprecedented growth and its billionaire founder, Jeff Bezos, revealing the most important business story of our time.</b><BR> <BR><b>&ldquo;If a company and a culture can have a biographer, Stone is Amazon&rsquo;s&#8212;which, given the retailer&rsquo;s ubiquity, makes him a biographer of the way all of us live now.&rdquo; &#8212;Jon Meacham, Pulitzer-Prize winner and #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author</b><BR><BR>Almost ten years ago, <i>Bloomberg </i>journalist Brad Stone captured the rise of Amazon in his bestseller <i>The Everything Store</i>. Since then, Amazon has expanded exponentially, inventing novel products like Alexa and disrupting countless industries, while its workforce has quintupled in size and its valuation has soared to well over a trillion dollars. Jeff Bezos&rsquo;s empire, once housed in a garage, now spans the globe. Between services like Whole Foods, Prime Video, and Amazon&rsquo;s cloud computing unit, AWS, plus Bezos&rsquo;s ownership of <i>The Washington Post</i>, it&rsquo;s impossible to go a day without encountering its impact. We live in a world run, supplied, and controlled by Amazon and its iconoclast founder.<BR> <BR>In <i>Amazon Unbound</i>, Brad Stone presents a deeply reported, vividly drawn portrait of how a retail upstart became one of the most powerful and feared entities in the global economy. Stone also probes the evolution of Bezos himself&#8212;who started as a geeky technologist totally devoted to building Amazon, but who transformed to become a fit, disciplined billionaire with global ambitions; who ruled Amazon with an iron fist, even as he found his personal life splashed over the tabloids.<BR> <BR>Definitive, timely, and revelatory, Stone has provided an unvarnished portrait of a man and company that we couldn&rsquo;t imagine modern life without.]]></d104>

Again. Only this time, it&rsquo;s not the police who find him. It&rsquo;s an evil harpy called Morg. And when she hauls him into Crackledawn, an Unmapped kingdom that conjures sunlight for our world, Zeb discovers running away only gets you so far. <BR> <BR>When magic&rsquo;s involved, you&rsquo;ve got to pick a side. And though Zeb vowed he wouldn&rsquo;t trust anyone ever again, he didn&rsquo;t expect to stumble aboard <i>The Kerfuffle</i>, an enchanted boat belonging to a girl called Oonie and her talking chameleon, Mrs. Fickletint.<BR> <BR>Suddenly, Zeb finds himself on a voyage complete with silver whales, fire krakens, and underwater palaces. Can he muster up enough trust in others, and in magic, to summon a dragon, find the Ember Scroll, and defeat Morg once and for all?<BR> <BR>This is a story about saving the world but it&rsquo;s also a story about trusting friends&#8212;and chameleons&#8212;even when kingdoms are falling apart.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[Abi Elphinstone grew up in Scotland where she spent most of her childhood building dens, hiding in tree houses, and running wild across highland glens. After being coaxed out of her treehouse, she studied English at Bristol University and then worked as a teacher in Africa, Berkshire, and London. She is the author of the Dreamsnatcher trilogy and the Unmapped Chronicles, among other books for young readers, and the editor of anthology&nbsp;<i>Winter Magic</i>. When she&rsquo;s not writing, Abi volunteers for the children&rsquo;s literacy charity Coram Beanstalk, speaks in schools, and travels the world looking for her next story.

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>Susan Orlean&#8212;the beloved <i>New Yorker</i> staff writer hailed as &ldquo;a national treasure&rdquo; by <i>The</i> <i>Washington Post</i> and the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Library Book</i>&#8212;gathers a lifetime of musings, meditations, and in-depth profiles about animals.</b> <i> </i><BR><BR>&ldquo;How we interact with animals has preoccupied philosophers, poets, and naturalists for ages,&rdquo; writes Susan Orlean. Since the age of six, when Orlean wrote and illustrated a book called <i>Herbert the Near-Sighted Pigeon</i>, she&rsquo;s been drawn to stories about how we live with animals, and how they abide by us. Now, in <i>On Animals</i>, she examines animal-human relationships through the compelling tales she has written over the course of her celebrated career.<BR> <BR>These stories consider a range of creatures&#8212;the household pets we dote on, the animals we raise to end up as meat on our plates, the creatures who could eat us for dinner, the various tamed and untamed animals we share our planet with who are central to human life. In her own backyard, Orlean discovers the delights of keeping chickens. In a different backyard, in New Jersey, she meets a woman who has twenty-three pet tigers&#8212;something none of her neighbors knew about until one of the tigers escapes. In Iceland, the world&rsquo;s most famous whale resists the efforts to set him free; in Morocco, the world&rsquo;s hardest-working donkeys find respite at a special clinic. We meet a show dog and a lost dog and a pigeon who knows exactly how to get home.<BR> <BR>Equal parts delightful and profound, enriched by Orlean&rsquo;s stylish prose and precise research, these stories celebrate the meaningful cross-species connections that grace our collective existence.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>A rich, dark urban fantasy debut following a teen witch who is given a horrifying task: sacrificing her first love to save her family&rsquo;s magic. The problem is, she&rsquo;s never been in love&#8212;she&rsquo;ll have to find the perfect guy before she can kill him.</b><BR><BR>After years of waiting for her Calling&#8212;a trial every witch must pass in order to come into their powers&#8212;the one thing Voya Thomas didn&rsquo;t expect was to fail. When Voya&rsquo;s ancestor gives her an unprecedented second chance to complete her Calling, she agrees&#8212;and then is horrified when her task is to kill her first love. And this time, failure means every Thomas witch will be stripped of their magic. <BR> <BR>Voya is determined to save her family&rsquo;s magic no matter the cost. The problem is, Voya has never been in love, so for her to succeed, she&rsquo;ll first have to find the perfect guy&#8212;and fast. Fortunately, a genetic matchmaking program has just hit the market. Her plan is to join the program, fall in love, and complete her task before the deadline. What she doesn&rsquo;t count on is being paired with the infuriating Luc&#8212;how can she fall in love with a guy who seemingly wants nothing to do with her? <BR> <BR>With mounting pressure from her family, Voya is caught between her morality and her duty to her bloodline. If she wants to save their heritage <i>and</i> Luc, she&rsquo;ll have to find something her ancestor wants more than blood. And in witchcraft, blood is everything.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>The definitive biography of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, detailing the remarkable rise and political brilliance of the most powerful&#8212;and elusive&#8212;woman in the world.</b><BR><BR><i>The Chancellor</i> is at once a riveting political biography and an intimate human story of a complete outsider&#8212;a research chemist and pastor&rsquo;s daughter raised in Soviet-controlled East Germany&#8212;who rose to become the unofficial leader of the West.<BR> <BR>Acclaimed biographer Kati Marton set out to pierce the mystery of how Angela Merkel achieved all this. And she found the answer in Merkel&rsquo;s political genius: in her willingness to talk <i>with</i> adversaries rather than over them, her skill at negotiating without ever compromising on what&rsquo;s most important to her, her canniness in appointing political rivals to her cabinet and exacting their policies so they have no platform to run against her, the humility to allow others to take credit for things done in tandem, the wisdom to stay out of the papers and off Twitter, and the vision to take advantage of crises to enact bold change.<BR> <BR>Famously private, the Angela Merkel who emerges in <i>The Chancellor</i> is a role model for anyone interested in gaining and keeping power while holding onto one&rsquo;s moral convictions&#8212;and for anyone looking to understand how to successfully bridge huge divisions within society. No modern leader has so ably confronted Russian aggression, provided homes to over a million refugees, and calmly unified Europe at a time when other countries are becoming more divided. But Marton also describes Merkel&rsquo;s many challenges, such as her complicated relationship with President Obama, who she at one point refused to speak to.<BR> <BR>This captivating portrait shows a woman who has survived extraordinary challenges to transform her own country and return it to the global stage. Timely and revelatory, this great morality tale shows the difference an exceptional leader can make for the greater good of a country and the world.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>A moving, inspirational, and &ldquo;masterfully told&rdquo; (Mike Dooley, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author) modern fable about a mysterious man who changes people&rsquo;s lives for the better&#8212;perfect for fans of <i>The Celestine Prophecy</i>.</b><BR><BR>Wherever he goes, the Dreamseller enchants, stirs up trouble, and inspires his listeners to search for the most important thing: the heart of the human soul. Every person he meets is someone who has abandoned their dreams and is struggling through life: a professor who has stopped pursuing his passions; a lonely alcoholic with no family; the elderly who have lost their zest for life. Through his wisdom, the Dreamseller helps them to look into their silent hearts and get to the root of their unhappiness. <BR> <BR>An illuminating and &ldquo;intellectual novel&rdquo; (<i>Library Journal</i>) that will not only make you laugh and cry, it will help you reflect on the purpose of your life, teach you to value others, and empower you to believe in your dreams.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>Just in time for the Apocalypse comes a new Biblical scripture from God and thirteen-time Emmy Award&#8211;winning comedy writer David Javerbaum.</b><BR><BR>3,000 years ago, King David wrote <i>The Book of Psalms</i>&#8212;hymns in praise of God that became famous worldwide. Now, with humanity on the verge of a self-generated catastrophe, God (with the help of another David) has decided to return, and reverse, the favor.<BR> <BR>God has collected a cornucopia of insults of the human race in the form of prose, poetry, and parody. From topics as diverse as COVID-19, Trump, racism, abortion, meth, math, and on a lighter note, the platypus, God provides a 21st-century spin on life&rsquo;s many problems. And he&rsquo;s not alone: his son Jesus Christ has contributed thirty sermons of his own, updating some of his Biblical teachings for the modern audience. Even the Holy Ghost stops by to make sure you don&rsquo;t forget him. Anybody who&rsquo;s a fan @TheTweetofGod and/or NOT a fan of the human race is sure to love <i>The Book of Pslams</i>.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>A world-renowned critical care doctor offers hope for patients, their families, and the future of medicine in this timely, urgent, and compassionate work about the devastating and little-known physical and emotional effects of ICU stays.</b><BR><BR>Dr. Wes Ely was on his first ICU rotation as a resident-in-training when he was assigned to a patient named Teresa, who was barely clinging to life. With the help of advanced medical technology Teresa survived, but six weeks later, she returned in a wheelchair with memory loss and a baffling bone condition. Dr. Ely had saved her life, but in other ways, he had failed her. Though he didn&rsquo;t know it at the time, Teresa was the first case of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) he would encounter, and unfortunately, she would not be the last.<BR> <BR>Since then, Dr. Ely has conducted groundbreaking research into ICU-acquired diseases and brought his scientific findings to the bedside to provide better care for critically ill patients around the globe. His work has contributed to widely adopted protocols that improve the way healthcare is now delivered.<BR> <BR>In this rich blend of science, history, moving patient stories like Teresa&rsquo;s, and personal reflection, Dr. Ely, a leader in the field of ICU survivorship, journeys into the world of life-threatening illness and the devastation it wreaks in patients&rsquo; lives, long after its initial onset. He advocates for human-centered care in the technology-driven enclave of the modern ICU&#8212;saving lives whenever possible, providing dignity when death is inevitable, and offering support for patients after discharge. Dr. Ely offers guidance to future ICU patients and their families, and issues a wakeup call for healthcare professionals&#8212;himself included&#8212;to turn their gaze from the latest life-saving machinery and really see the person in the patient.<BR> <BR>Over the next 10 years, 40 to 60 million people in this country will be admitted to the ICU, and the average American will have at least one ICU stay in their lifetime. Dr. Ely shows that there is now a proven path toward a better way of life for patients, and his book is an invaluable resource to anyone whose life will be touched by critical illness.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>The extraordinarily moving memoir by a Holocaust survivor who saved an untold number of lives at Auschwitz through everyday acts of courage and kindness&#8212;in the vein of <i>A Bookshop in Berlin </i>and <i>The Nazi Officer&rsquo;s Wife</i>.</b><BR><BR>In March 1942, twenty-five-year-old kindergarten teacher Magda Hellinger and nearly a thousand other young women were deported as some of the first Jews to be sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp.<BR> <BR>The SS soon discovered that by putting prisoners in day-to-day charge of the accommodation blocks, they could deflect attention away from themselves. Magda was one such prisoner selected for leadership and put in charge of hundreds of women in the notorious Experimental Block 10. She found herself constantly walking a dangerously fine line: saving lives while avoiding suspicion by the SS and risking execution. Through her inner strength and shrewd survival instincts, she was able to rise above the horror and cruelty of the camps and build pivotal relationships with the women under her watch, and even some of Auschwitz&rsquo;s most notorious Nazi senior officers.<BR> <BR>Based on Magda&rsquo;s personal account and completed by her daughter&rsquo;s extensive research, this awe-inspiring tale offers us incredible insight into human nature, the power of resilience, and the goodness that can shine through even in the most horrific of conditions.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>The author of the &ldquo;sweeping, stirring, and heartrending&rdquo; (Kristin Harmel, author of <i>The Room on Rue Am&#233;lie</i>) <i>The Light Over London </i>returns with a masterful, glittering novel that whisks you to midcentury Britain as it follows three of the last debutantes to be presented to Queen Elizabeth II.</b><BR><BR>When it&rsquo;s announced that 1958 will be the last year debutantes are to be presented at court, thousands of eager mothers and hopeful daughters flood the palace with letters seeking the year&rsquo;s most coveted invitation: a chance for their daughters to curtsey to the young Queen Elizabeth and officially come out into society.<BR> <BR>In an effort to appease her traditional mother, aspiring university student Lily Nichols agrees to become a debutante and do the Season, a glittering and grueling string of countless balls and cocktail parties. In doing so, she befriends two very different women: the cool and aloof Leana Hartford whose apparent perfection hides a darker side and the ambitious Katherine Norman who dreams of a career once she helps her parents find their place among the elite.<BR> <BR>But the glorious effervescence of the Season evaporates once Lily learns a devastating secret that threatens to destroy her entire family. Faced with a dark past, she&rsquo;s forced to ask herself what really matters: her family legacy or her own happiness.<BR> <BR>With her signature &ldquo;intricate, tender, and convincing&rdquo; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>) storytelling, Julia Kelly weaves an unforgettable tale of female friendship amid the twilight days of Britain&rsquo;s grand coming out balls.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>For fans of the hit basketball documentary <i>The Last Dance</i>, and from award-winning <i>Boston Globe</i> columnist Dan Shaughnessy, a nostalgia-filled retelling of the Boston Celtics&rsquo; 1980s dominance, which featured the sublime play of NBA legend Larry Bird.</b><BR><BR>Today the NBA is a vast global franchise&#8212;a billion-dollar industry viewed by millions of fans in the United States and abroad. But it wasn&rsquo;t always this successful. Before primetime ESPN coverage, lucrative branding deals like Air Jordans, and $40 million annual player salaries, there was the NBA of the 1970s and 1980s&#8212;when basketball was still an up-and-coming sport featuring old school beat reporters and players wore Converse All-Stars.<BR> <BR>Enter Dan Shaughnessy, then the beat reporter for <i>The</i> <i>Boston Globe </i>who covered the Boston Celtics every day from 1982 to1986. It was a time when reporters travelled with professional teams&#8212;flying the same commercial airlines, riding the same buses, and staying in the same hotels. Shaughnessy knew the athletes as real people, losing free throw bets to Larry Bird, being gifted cheap cigars by the iconic coach Red Auerbach, and having his one-year-old daughter Sarah passed from player to player on a flight from Logan to Detroit Metro.<BR> <BR>Drawing on unprecedented access and personal experiences that would not be possible for any reporter today, Shaughnessy takes us inside the legendary Larry Bird-led Celtics teams, capturing the camaraderie as they rose to dominate the NBA. Fans can witness the cockiness of Larry Bird (who once walked into an All Star Weekend locker room, announced that he was going to win the three-point contest, and <i>did</i>); the ageless athleticism of Robert Parish; the shooting skills of Kevin McHale; the fierce, self-sacrificing play of Bill Walton; and the playful humor of players like Danny Ainge, Cedric &ldquo;Cornbread&rdquo; Maxwell, and M.L. Carr.<BR> <BR>For any fan who longs to return&#8212;for just a few hours&#8212;to those magical years when the Boston Garden rocked, the LA Lakers were the perennial mountain to be climbed, and the winner&rsquo;s circle was mostly colored Boston Green, <i>Wish It Lasted Forever </i>is a VIP courtside seat and masterful tribute to the Larry Bird era and the Celtics&rsquo; age of dominance.&#8203;]]></d104>

Since then, the geography hasn&rsquo;t changed, but the world has.<BR> <BR>Now, in this revelatory new book, Marshall takes us into ten regions that are set to shape global politics and power. Find out why the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere is the world&rsquo;s next battleground; why the fight for the Pacific is just beginning; and why Europe&rsquo;s next refugee crisis is closer than we think.<BR> <BR>In ten chapters covering Australia, The Sahel, Greece, Turkey, the UK, Iran, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, Spain and Space, Marshall explains how a region&rsquo;s geography and physical characteristics affect the decisions made by its leaders. Innovative, compelling, and delivered with Marshall&rsquo;s trademark wit and insight, this is a gripping and enlightening exploration of the power of geography to shape humanity&rsquo;s past, present, and&#8212;most importantly&#8212;our future.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>Emmy Award&#173;&#8211;winning actress Sharon Gless tells all in this laugh-out-loud, juicy, and touching memoir about her five decades in Hollywood, where she took on some of the most groundbreaking roles of her time.</b><BR><BR>Anyone who has seen Sharon Gless act in <i>Cagney and Lacey</i>,<i> Queer as Folk</i>, <i>Burn Notice</i>, and countless other shows and movies, knows that she&rsquo;s someone who gives every role her all. She holds nothing back in <i>Apparently There Were Complaints,</i> a hilarious, deeply personal memoir that spills all about Gless&rsquo;s five decades in Hollywood.<BR> <BR>A fifth-generation Californian, Sharon Gless knew from a young age that she wanted to be an actress. After some rocky teenage years that included Sharon&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; divorce and some minor (and not-so-minor) rebellion, Gless landed a coveted spot as an exclusive contract player for Universal Studios. In 1982, she stepped into the role of New York Police Detective Christine Cagney for the series <i>Cagney and Lacey</i>, which eventually reached an audience of 30 million weekly viewers and garnered Gless with two Emmy Awards. The show made history as the first hour-long drama to feature two women in the leading roles.<BR> <BR>Gless continued to make history long after <i>Cagney and Lacey</i> was over. In 2000, she took on the role of outrageous Debbie Novotny in <i>Queer as Folk</i>. Her portrayal of a devoted mother to a gay son and confidant to his gay friends touched countless hearts and changed the definition of family for millions of viewers.<BR> <BR><i>Apparently There Were Complaints</i> delves into Gless&rsquo;s remarkable career and explores Gless&rsquo;s complicated family, her struggles with alcoholism, and her fear of romantic commitment as well as her encounters with some of the Hollywood&rsquo;s biggest names. Brutally honest and incredibly relatable, Gless puts it all out on the page in the same way she has lived&#8212;never with moderation.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>An African tightrope walker who can&rsquo;t die gets embroiled in a secret society&rsquo;s deadly gladiatorial tournament in this thrilling historical fantasy set in an alternate 1880s London, perfect for fans of <i>The Last Magician</i> and <i>The Gilded Wolves</i>.</b><BR><BR>As an African tightrope dancer in Victorian London, Iris is used to being strange. She is certainly a strange sight for leering British audiences always eager for the spectacle of <i>colonial curiosity</i>. But Iris also has a secret that even &ldquo;strange&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t capture&hellip;&#8203;<BR> <BR>She cannot die. <BR> <BR>Haunted by her unnatural power and with no memories of her past, Iris is obsessed with discovering who she is. But that mission gets more complicated when she meets the dark and alluring Adam Temple, a member of a mysterious order called the Enlightenment Committee. Adam seems to know much more about her than he lets on, and he shares with her a terrifying revelation: the world is ending, and the Committee will decide who lives&hellip;and who doesn&rsquo;t. <BR> <BR>To help them choose a leader for the upcoming apocalypse, the Committee is holding the Tournament of Freaks, a macabre competition made up of vicious fighters with fantastical abilities. Adam wants Iris to be his champion, and in return he promises her the one thing she wants most: the truth about who she really is. <BR> <BR>If Iris wants to learn about her shadowy past, she has no choice but to fight. But the further she gets in the grisly tournament, the more she begins to remember&#8212;and the more she wonders if the truth is something best left forgotten.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>A hilarious and whip-smart collection of essays, offering an intimate look at bisexuality, gender, and, of course, sex. Perfect for fans of Lindy West, Samantha Irby, and Rebecca Solnit&#8212;and anyone who wants, and deserves, to be seen. </b><BR><BR>If Jen Winston knows one thing for sure, it&rsquo;s that she&rsquo;s bisexual. Or wait&#8212;maybe she isn&rsquo;t? Actually, she definitely is. Unless&hellip;she&rsquo;s not?<BR> <BR>Jen&rsquo;s provocative, laugh-out-loud debut takes us inside her journey of self-discovery, leading us through stories of a childhood &ldquo;girl crush,&rdquo; an onerous quest to have a threesome, and an enduring fear of being bad at sex. <i>Greedy</i> follows Jen&rsquo;s attempts to make sense of herself as she explores the role of the male gaze, what it means to be &ldquo;queer enough,&rdquo; and how to overcome bi stereotypes when you&rsquo;re the posterchild for all of them: greedy, slutty, and constantly confused. <BR> <BR>With her clever voice and clear-eyed insight, Jen draws on personal experiences with sexism and biphobia to understand how we all can and must do better. She sheds light on the reasons women, queer people, and other marginalized groups tend to make ourselves smaller, provoking the question: What would happen if we suddenly stopped?&#8203;&#8203;<BR> <BR><i>Greedy</i> shows us that being bisexual is about so much more than who you&rsquo;re sleeping with&#8212;it&rsquo;s about finding stability in a state of flux and defining yourself on your own terms. This book inspires us to rethink the world as we know it, reminding us that <i>Greedy </i>was a superpower all along.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>A sweeping reassessment of the American Revolution, showing how the Founders were influenced by overlooked Americans&#8212;women, Native Americans, African Americans, and religious dissenters. </b><BR><BR>Using more than a thousand eyewitness accounts, <i>Liberty Is Sweet</i> explores countless connections between the Patriots of 1776 and other Americans whose passion for freedom often brought them into conflict with the Founding Fathers. &ldquo;It is all one story,&rdquo; prizewinning historian Woody Holton writes.<BR> <BR>Holton describes the origins and crucial battles of the Revolution from Lexington and Concord to the British surrender at Yorktown, always focusing on marginalized Americans&#8212;enslaved Africans and African Americans, Native Americans, women, and dissenters&#8212;and on overlooked factors such as weather, North America&rsquo;s unique geography, chance, misperception, attempts to manipulate public opinion, and (most of all) disease. Thousands of enslaved Americans exploited the chaos of war to obtain their own freedom, while others were given away as enlistment bounties to whites. Women provided material support for the troops, sewing clothes for soldiers and in some cases taking part in the fighting. Both sides courted native people and mimicked their tactics.<BR> <BR><i>Liberty Is Sweet</i> gives us our most complete account of the American Revolution, from its origins on the frontiers and in the Atlantic ports to the creation of the Constitution. Offering surprises at every turn&#8212;for example, Holton makes a convincing case that Britain never had a chance of winning the war&#8212;this majestic history revivifies a story we thought we already knew.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>From <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Laura Taylor Namey comes an exquisitely crafted, heartrending novel about friendship and the bittersweetness of growing up and growing apart.</b><BR><BR>When they were fifteen, Willa, Luz, and Britton&rsquo;s friendship was everything.<BR> When they were sixteen, they stood by each other no matter what.<BR> When they were seventeen, they went through the worst.<BR> And when they were eighteen, Willa ruined it all.<BR> <BR>Now, it&rsquo;s the week of graduation, and Willa is left with only a memory box filled with symbols of the friendship she destroyed: A book of pranks. Corsages from a nightmarish homecoming. A greasy pizza menu. Greeting cards with words that mean the world&hellip; It&rsquo;s enough to make Willa wonder how anything could tear her, Luz, and Britton apart. But as Willa revisits the moments when she and her friends leaned on each other, she can&rsquo;t avoid the moments they leaned so hard their friendship began to crack.<BR> <BR>As Willa tries to find a way back to Luz and Britton, she must confront the why of her betrayal, and answer a question she never saw coming: Who is she without them?]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>For fans of the Netflix hit original series <i>Dead to Me</i> comes &ldquo;a captivating thriller&rdquo; (Megan Miranda, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author) about what happens when the death of a husband and father isn&rsquo;t the tragedy everyone believes. </b><BR><BR>Emma Walsh&rsquo;s looks-great-on-the-outside marriage is at the breaking point, and she&rsquo;s finally worked up the courage to confront her husband James about his drinking&#8212;his alcoholic rages, his blackouts, the uncertainty and fear his behavior has created for her and their two kids. But James never shows up to meet her as planned, and all her righteous words go unsaid. And unsaid they remain, because the next time Emma sees James, his body is crumpled amidst the wreckage of his flashy car, smashed to its final resting place halfway through the back wall of their suburban house&rsquo;s roomy garage. <BR> <BR>In the aftermath of the fatal crash, she and her teenage children, Kelsey and Hunter, begin to imagine life without the looming, volcanic presence of their husband and father. Buoyed by the support of her two closest friends, Emma struggles to deal with her grief, complicated by the knowledge that James&rsquo;s legacy as an upstanding business owner and family man shines only because so many people were so willing, for so long, to keep his secrets&#8212;secrets that twist into new and unexpected shapes as the mysterious details of his last day of life begin to come to light.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>Former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada Beverley McLachlin offers an intimate and revealing look at her life from her childhood in the Alberta foothills to her career on the Supreme Court, where she helped to shape the social and moral fabric of the country.</b><BR><BR>As a young girl, Beverley McLachlin&rsquo;s world was often full of wonder&#8212;at the expansive prairie vistas around her, at the stories she discovered in the books at her local library, and at the diverse people who passed through her parents&rsquo; door. While her family was poor, their lives were rich in the ways that mattered most. Even at a young age, she had an innate sense of justice, which was reinforced by the lessons her parents taught her: Everyone deserves dignity. All people are equal. Those who work hard reap the rewards. Willful, spirited, and unusually intelligent, she discovered in Pincher Creek an extraordinary tapestry of people and perspectives that informed her worldview going forward.<BR> <BR>Still, life in the rural Prairies was lonely, and gaining access to education&#8212;especially for girls&#8212;wasn&rsquo;t always easy. As a young woman, McLachlin moved to Edmonton to pursue a degree in philosophy. There, she discovered her passion lay not in academia, but in the real world, solving problems directly related to the lives of the people around her. And in the law, she found the tools to do exactly that.<BR> <BR>She soon realized, though, that the world was not always willing to accept her. In her early years as an articling student and lawyer, she encountered sexism, exclusion, and old boys&rsquo; clubs at every turn. And outside the courtroom, personal loss and tragedies struck close to home. Nonetheless, McLachlin was determined to prove her worth, and her love of the law and the pursuit of justice pulled her through the darkest moments.<BR> <BR>McLachlin&rsquo;s meteoric rise through the courts soon found her serving on the highest court in the country, becoming the first woman to be named Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. She rapidly distinguished herself as a judge of renown, one who was never afraid to take on morally complex or charged debates. Over the next eighteen years, McLachlin presided over the most prominent cases in the country&#8212;involving Charter challenges, same-sex marriage, and euthanasia. One judgment at a time, she laid down a legal legacy that proved that fairness and justice were not luxuries of the powerful but rather obligations owed to each and every one of us.<BR> <BR>With warmth, honesty, and deep wisdom, McLachlin invites us into her legal and personal life&#8212;into the hopes and doubts, the triumphs and losses on and off the bench. Through it all, her constant faith in justice remained her true north. In an age of division and uncertainty, McLachlin&rsquo;s memoir is a reminder that justice and the rule of law remain our best hope for a progressive and bright future.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>#1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Kathy Reichs returns with a new riveting novel featuring her vastly popular character forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan, who must use all her tradecraft to discover the identity of a faceless corpse, its connection to a decade-old missing child case, and why the dead man had her cellphone number.</b><BR><BR>It&rsquo;s sweltering in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Temperance Brennan, still recovering from neurosurgery following an aneurysm, is battling nightmares, migraines, and what she thinks might be hallucinations when she receives a series of mysterious text messages, each containing a new picture of a corpse that is missing its face and hands. Immediately, she&rsquo;s anxious to know who the dead man is, and why the images were sent to her.<BR> <BR> An unidentified corpse soon turns up, only partly answering her questions.<BR> <BR> To win answers to the others, including the man&rsquo;s identity, she must go rogue, working mostly outside the system. That&rsquo;s because Tempe&rsquo;s new boss holds a fierce grudge against her and is determined to keep her off the case. Tempe bulls forward anyway, even as she begins questioning her instincts. But the clues she discovers are disturbing and confusing. Was the faceless man a spy? A trafficker? A target for assassination by the government? And why was he carrying the name of a child missing for almost a decade?<BR> <BR> With help from a number of law enforcement associates including her Montreal beau Andrew Ryan and the always-ready-with-a-smart-quip, ex-homicide investigator Skinny Slidell, and utilizing new cutting-edge forensic methods, Tempe draws closer to the astonishing truth.<BR> <BR> But the more she uncovers, the darker and more twisted the picture becomes...]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>From the #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>A Man Called Ove</i> and &ldquo;writer of astonishing depth&rdquo; (<i>The Washington Times</i>) comes a poignant comedy about a crime that never took place, a would-be bank robber who disappears into thin air, and eight extremely anxious strangers who find they have more in common than they ever imagined.</b><BR><BR>Viewing an apartment normally doesn&rsquo;t turn into a life-or-death situation, but this particular open house becomes just that when a failed bank robber bursts in and takes everyone in the apartment hostage. As the pressure mounts, the eight strangers begin slowly opening up to one another and reveal long-hidden truths.<BR> <BR>First is Zara, a wealthy bank director who has been too busy to care about anyone else until tragedy changed her life. Now, she&rsquo;s obsessed with visiting open houses to see how ordinary people live&#8212;and, perhaps, to send an old wrong to right. Then there&rsquo;s Roger and Anna-Lena, an Ikea-addicted retired couple who are on a never-ending hunt for fixer-uppers to hide the fact that they don&rsquo;t know how to fix their own failing marriage. Julia and Ro are a young lesbian couple and soon-to-be parents who are nervous about their chances for a successful life together since they can&rsquo;t agree on anything. And there&rsquo;s Estelle<b>, </b>an eighty year-old woman who has lived long enough to be unimpressed by a masked bank robber waving a gun in her face. And despite the story she tells them all, Estelle hasn&rsquo;t really come to the apartment to view it for her daughter, and her husband really isn&rsquo;t outside parking the car.<BR> <BR>As police surround the premises and television channels broadcast the hostage situation live, the tension mounts and even deeper secrets are slowly revealed. Before long, the robber must decide which is the more terrifying prospect: going out to face the police, or staying in the apartment with this group of impossible people.<BR> <BR>Rich with Fredrik Backman&rsquo;s &ldquo;pitch-perfect dialogue and an unparalleled understanding of human nature&rdquo; (<i>Shelf Awareness</i>), <i>Anxious People</i>&rsquo;s whimsical plot serves up unforgettable insights into the human condition and a gentle reminder to be compassionate to all the anxious people we encounter every day.]]></d104>

      <d104><![CDATA[<b>#1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Kathy Reichs returns with her twentieth gripping novel featuring forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan, whose examinations, fifteen years apart, of unidentified bodies washed up from the sea may be connected to a deadly new pestilence.</b><BR><BR>A storm has hit South Carolina, dredging up crimes of the past.<BR> <BR>En route to Isle of Palms, a barrier island off the South Carolina coast, forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan receives a call from the Charleston coroner. During the storm, a medical waste container has washed up on the beach. Inside are two decomposed bodies wrapped in plastic sheeting and bound with electrical wire. Chillingly, Tempe recognizes many details as identical to those of an unsolved case she handled in Quebec fifteen earlier. With a growing sense of foreboding, she flies to Montreal to gather evidence and convince her boss Pierre LaManch to reopen the cold case. She also seeks the advice&#8212;and comfort&#8212;of her longtime beau Andrew Ryan.<BR> <BR>Meanwhile, a storm of a different type gathers force in South Carolina. The citizens of Charleston are struck by capnocytophaga, a bacterium that, at its worst, can eat human flesh. Thousands panic and test themselves for a rare genetic mutation that may have rendered them vulnerable.<BR> <BR>Shockingly, Tempe eventually deduces not only that the victims in both grisly murder cases are related, but that the murders and the disease outbreak also have a common cause.]]></d104>
